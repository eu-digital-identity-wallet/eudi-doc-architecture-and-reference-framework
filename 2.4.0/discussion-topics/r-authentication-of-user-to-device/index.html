<h1 id="r-authentication-of-the-user-to-the-device">R - Authentication of the User to the device</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper Topic Description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group regarding Topic R: Authentication of the User to the device.</p>
<p>The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p><em>Requirements and guidance need to be provided to address the authentication methods available on modern mobile devices, such as PIN codes, swipe patterns, and biometrics (e.g., face or fingerprint recognition).</em></p>
<p>The device here means the User's device where the Wallet Instance is installed.</p>
<h3 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key Words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and options specified in this document.
In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document Structure</h3>
<p>The document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 presents the legal requirements for functionality related to authentication of the User to the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 3 presents and discusses a list of identified issues, with suggested changes and/or new High-Level Requirements related to this topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 4 presents a log of the additions and changes that will be made to High Level Requirements in the ARF as a result of discussing this topic with the Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 5 refers to other topics related to authentication of the User to the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 6 presents the additions and changes that will be made to the ARF main document as a result of discussions. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-for-authentication-of-the-user-to-the-device">2 Legal Requirements for authentication of the User to the device</h2>
<p>The following legal texts impose requirements on authentication of the User to the device: 
- [European Digital Identity Regulation],
- [CIR 2024/2979] as regards the integrity and core functionalities of European Digital Identity Wallets,
- [CIR 2015/1502] on setting out minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance levels for electronic identification means,
- [CIR 2024/2981] as regards the certification of European Digital Identity Wallets.</p>
<p>This section recaps the respective legal requirements from these sources.</p>
<h3 id="21-european-digital-identity-regulation-about-authentication-of-the-user-to-the-device">2.1  [European Digital Identity Regulation] about authentication of the User to the device</h3>
<p>The [European Digital Identity Regulation] does not contain direct requirements for authentication of the User to the device, however it provides  definition of the Strong User Authentication in Article 3(51):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘strong user authentication’ means an authentication based on the use of at least two authentication factors from different categories of either knowledge, something only the user knows, possession, something only the user possesses or inherence, something the user is, that are independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, and is designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wallet Unit is supposed to be a means of strong user authentication agains Wallet-Relying Parties and their services, while the authentication methods provided by the device to the User, are part of this means. </p>
<p>At the same time, the Wallet Unit with the PID is the electronic identification means, as defined by Article 3(2): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“electronic identification means” means a material and/or immaterial unit containing person identification data and which is used for authentication for an online service or, where appropriate, for an offline service;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and according to Article 5a(5)(d) shall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>meet the requirements set out in Article 8 with regard to assurance level high, in particular as applied to the requirements for identity proofing and verification, and electronic identification means management and authentication;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the authentication methods provided by the device to the User shall comply with with applicable requirements for LoA High and strong customer authentication, set out by eIDAS and the implementing acts (see the next sections).</p>
<h3 id="22-implementing-acts-about-authentication-of-the-user-to-the-device">2.2 Implementing acts about authentication of the User to the device</h3>
<p>[CIR 2024/2979] contains general requirements that:
+ the Wallet Unit shall authenticate the User prior to any further action with the Wallet Unit,
+ the Wallet unit shall meet requirements for the characteristics and design of electronic identification means at assurance level high.</p>
<p>Below are selected excerpts from the [CIR 2024/2979] that establish these requirements.</p>
<p>Article 3(1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wallet units shall not perform any functionality listed in Article 5a(4) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, except wallet user authentication to access the wallet unit, until the wallet unit has successfully authenticated the wallet user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 5(1): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wallet providers shall ensure that wallet secure cryptographic applications:</p>
<p>(a) perform wallet cryptographic operations involving critical assets other than those needed for the wallet unit to authenticate the wallet user only in cases where those applications have successfully authenticated wallet users;</p>
<p>(b) where they authenticate wallet users in the context of performing electronic identification at assurance level high; perform authentication of wallet users, in accordance with, the requirements for the characteristics and design of electronic identification means at assurance level high, as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, at least the following requirements needs to be taken into account from [CIR 2015/1502]:
+ From section 2.2.1 Electronic identification means characteristics and design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The electronic identification means utilises at least two authentication factors from different categories.
The electronic identification means is designed so that it can be assumed to be used only if under the control or possession of the person to whom it belongs. 
The electronic identification means protects against duplication and tampering as well as against attackers with high attack potential
The electronic identification means is designed so that it can be reliably protected by the person to whom it belongs against use by others.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From section 2.2.2. Issuance, delivery and activation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The activation process verifies that the electronic identification means was delivered only into the possession of the person to whom it belongs.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>From section 2.3.1. Authentication mechanism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where person identification data is stored as part of the authentication mechanism, that information is secured in order to protect against loss and against compromise, including analysis offline.
The authentication mechanism implements security controls for the verification of the electronic identification means, so that it is highly unlikely that activities such as guessing, eavesdropping, replay or manipulation of communication by an attacker with enhanced-basic attack potential can subvert the authentication mechanisms.
The authentication mechanism implements security controls for the verification of the electronic identification means, so that it is highly unlikely that activities such as guessing, eavesdropping, replay or manipulation of communication by an attacker with high attack potential can subvert the authentication mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most of the above referenced security requirements are related to the robustness and reliability of the mechanisms offered by the Wallet Solution and the device, and are to be proven by certification of the Wallet Solution; this is covered by [CIR 2024/2981].</p>
<h2 id="3-discussion">3 Discussion</h2>
<p>The solution of "means of electronic identification" and "strong user authentication" offered by the (device-based) Wallet Solution is interpreted the following way.</p>
<p>The first authentication factor (possession) is a PID or other device-bound attestation possibly (where the associated private key is stored in WSCD).</p>
<p>The second authentication factor can be:
+ a device build-in mechanism for authenticating the User to the device (such as a biometric factor, PIN or password), or
+ a mechanism offered by the Wallet Instance itself (such as application PIN, password or other) - this is however out of the scope of this topic.</p>
<p>Therefore, device build-in mechanism must comply with the requirements set out for means of electronic identification for LoA High mutatis mutandis, such as:
+ proper activation process, that should cover setting up or verification of the available device authentication methods,
+ device authentication methods and their minimal "strength".</p>
<p>The topics for discusison in this paper are the following:
+ activation process,
+ authentication process,
+ non device-bound attestations.</p>
<p>Note: this document is intended ONLY to clarify the high-level requirements related to authentication of the User to the device. The necessary technical specifications (including any policy documents) will be developed by the European Commission if necessary, and after an agreement on the requirements has been reached.</p>
<h3 id="31-activation-process">3.1 Activation process</h3>

<p>In the opinion of the ARF editors team, the above requirements are sufficient.

<p><strong>Question 2: Is there a need to update the requirements?</strong></p>
<h3 id="33-non-device-bound-attestations">3.3 Non device-bound attestations</h3>
<p>The current ARF requimrents do not distinguish whether, in the context of attribute presentations, the authentication process of the User to the device concerns device-bound or non-device-bound attestation - as of now same requirements apply to both.</p>
<p>At the same time there are use cases such as event tickets or discount vouchers, where the bound to the device is not needed or even not wanted (eg. for ensuring easy portability). In such cases the level of assurance needed by the Wallet-Relying Party is minimal. Therefore, the requirements related to authentication of the User to the device might be relaxed.
However, Article 3(1) of [CIR 2024/2979] mandates performing always some kind of user authentication before "any functionality" is used (see section 2.2). </p>
<p>Note: The issue of non device-bound attestation is a subject of comprehensive discussion within the Topic Z and the outcome of the discussion needs to be applied accordingly. </p>
<p><strong>Question 3: Is there a need to address directly the non device-bound attestations use case (eg. less stringent requirements for authentication of the User to the device)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 4: To what extent the authentication of the User to the device can be reduced in the non device-bound attestation context?</strong></p>
