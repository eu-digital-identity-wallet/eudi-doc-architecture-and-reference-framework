<h1 id="t-support-and-maintenance-by-the-wallet-provider">T - Support and Maintenance by the Wallet Provider</h1>
<p>Version 0.2, 14 Oct 2025</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions/583">Link to GitHub discussion</a></p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper topic description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for European Digital Identity Cooperation Group
on topic <strong>T - Support and Maintenance by the Wallet Provider</strong></p>
<p>The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p><em>Are specific requirements necessary to govern support and maintenance of the Wallet? For instance, guidelines could clarify what types of data the Wallet Provider is permitted or prohibited from collecting from Wallet Instances for support and maintenance purposes.</em></p>
<p>Following the [European Digital Identity Regulation] (EU) 2024/1183 this document discusses high-level technical requirements and guidance and/or recommendations the ARF should include on Wallet Provider specific maintenance and support functions. It should be noted that the requirements covered here are different from certification-related security requirements - this paper focuses on post-certification maintenance and support that may mean active monitoring of the Wallet Instance and Wallet Unit elements and behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key words</h2>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.</p>
<p>In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is
mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas
other words, such as 'will' and 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of
fact.</p>
<h2 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document structure</h2>
<p>This document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 introduces support and maintenance expectations set on Wallet Providers based on the existing legislation and the ARF, and lists the Annex 2 HLRs found to relate (also, in addition to their home topic) with support and maintenance on the latest ARF version (2.6.0).</li>
<li>Chapter 3 opens the discussion whether specific high-level requirements are desirable.</li>
<li>Chapter 4 will list the additions and changes that will be made to the ARF as a result of discussing this topic with Member States.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-existing-requirements-related-to-wallet-providers-support-and-maintenance-duties">2. Existing requirements related to Wallet Provider's support and maintenance duties</h2>
<h3 id="21-regulatory-requirements">2.1 Regulatory requirements</h3>
<p>Article 5a (10) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] specifies that Providers of European Digital Identity Wallets shall ensure that users can easily request technical support and report technical problems or any other incidents having a negative impact on the use of European Digital Identity Wallets.</p>
<h3 id="22-sections-in-the-arf-related-to-wallet-solution-and-wallet-unit-lifecycle-management">2.2 Sections in the ARF related to Wallet Solution and Wallet Unit lifecycle management</h3>
<p>The Trust model discussion in the ARF main text (Section 6) has the following lifecycle management related subsections, and although not directly mentioning the support duties of the Wallet Provider, may be relevant for this topic:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md#623-wallet-provider-suspension-or-cancellation">Section 6.2.3</a> of the main document discusses what happens on Wallet Unit level if a Wallet Provider is cancelled or suspended. Informing duty by the Wallet Provider of such event for the Wallet Users is defined in Annex 2/<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2338-topic-38---wallet-unit-revocation">Topic 38</a> part B part of the ARF.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md#65-trust-throughout-a-wallet-unit-lifecycle">Section 6.5</a> of the main document discusses Wallet Unit lifecycle related trust. Once a Wallet User has a Wallet Unit in Operational or Valid state, the Wallet Unit is managed by the User and the Wallet Provider, and this management includes at least revoking the Wallet Unit when necessary.</p>
<p>The ARF sub-section <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md#654-wallet-unit-management">6.5.4</a> covers the details (<strong>bold text</strong> effect added by the editor):</p>

The recommended solution is to take advantage of a User authentication event to also carry out any necessary cleaning operations.</em></td>

<h2 id="3-discussion">3 Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="31-non-functional-requirements">3.1 Non-functional requirements</h3>
<p>The support and maintenance functions of the Wallet Provider are in the current ARF mostly implicit and embedded under technical topics that either link to issuance, revocation or lifecycle management of technical artefacts (functional requirements under various topics).</p>
<p>Some functions of a Wallet Provider related to sustained customer support, data protection and active engineering towards keeping the Wallet Instances of an Wallet Solution up to date are part of Wallet certification. This is covered via implementing acts and by the Member States' national certification schemes, and are beyond the mandate of the [Regulation]. Thus, the ARF will not list non-functional requirements for the topic(s).</p>
<h3 id="32-wallet-instance-maintenance-related-data-collection">3.2 Wallet Instance maintenance related data collection</h3>
<p>Wallet Solution maintenance requires monitoring of the solution functions by the Wallet Provider, including Wallet Instances used by the users. It is customary for the mobile application developers to collect limited bug and error reports at runtime for improvement purposes (the development team will receive these and prioritise error fixes according to professional error severity analysis). Error logs collected should never contain personal data of the User. Question of what data of the Wallet User, or of the Wallet Instance should be monitored for this purpose was discussed in the first meeting to collect suitable data points, and are documented in table 1. </p>
<p>In case the Wallet Instance is run mostly remote (at the Wallet Solution Provider server with associated HSM), the Wallet Instance can be just a 'viewer' app, and therefore multiple apps can be viewed as the same Wallet Instance. Nevertheless, he ARF defines (see topic 38, WURevocation_09) how the Wallet Provider must handle situation where one 'viewer app', one part of its components is no longer secure - The Wallet Unit is revoked entirely in case the data collected from a single device/app triggers need to revoke an individual app instance.</p>
<p>List of possible data type to be collected, reasons for collection and how the Wallet Instance monitoring should occur (frequency, mechanisms, should the collection require Wallet User's approval beyond standard app vendor practices) is collected in the following table, and is recommended to be added to <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md#6532-wallet-provider-requests-data-about-the-users-device-from-the-wallet-instance">section 6.5.3.2</a> of the ARF:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Are there monitoring needs for short-range radio (BLE, NFC) usage logs over proximity use cases regarding either maintenance monitoring (this section) or for Wallet Unit security posture analysis (next section)?</p>
<p>Device OS-dependent app crash logs will probably collect a rich set of data (many of listed items above) automatically. App developers should write custom crash logs for sending them to Wallet Provider's server for further analysis. For iOS developers see article <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/acquiring-crash-reports-and-diagnostic-logs">Acquiring crash reports and diagnostic logs</a>, and respectively <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9844486?sjid=7862630290407449217-EU#zippy=">Android vitals</a> for Android/Google Play distributed apps. Beyond baseline tools, several third party tools exist for creating developer-friendly crash report analytics.</p>
<p>A new HLR on custom crash logs is suggested for inclusion under the topic (see Section 4.1, WPSM_02).</p>
<h3 id="33-monitoring-data-for-the-wallet-units-security-posture">3.3 Monitoring data for the Wallet Unit's security posture</h3>
<h4 id="331-backgrounder-the-pds2-directive">3.3.1 Backgrounder - the PDS2 Directive</h4>
<p>The need to track the security posture of a Wallet Unit was initially raised in <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/aa-support-of-electronic-payments-SCA-with-wallet.md">topic AA</a> discussion on strong customer authentication and related requirements from the regulation that binds the European financial institutions, especially the Payment Service Providers (PSPs). The [RTS SCA] contains generic requirements for PSPs in Article 2 to have transaction monitoring mechanisms to detect unauthorised or fraudulent transactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Payment service providers shall have transaction monitoring mechanisms in place that enable them to detect unauthorised or fraudulent payment transactions for the purpose of the implementation of the security measures referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 1. Those mechanisms shall be based on the analysis of payment transactions taking into account elements which are typical of the payment service user in the circumstances of a normal use of the personalised security credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment service providers shall ensure that the transaction monitoring mechanisms take into account, at a minimum, each of the following risk-based factors:
(a) lists of compromised or stolen authentication elements;
(b) the amount of each payment transaction;
(c) known fraud scenarios in the provision of payment services;
(d) signs of malware infection in any sessions of the authentication procedure;
(e) in case the access device or the software is provided by the payment service provider, a log of the use of the access device or the software provided to the payment service user and the abnormal use of the access device or the software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The ARF does not cover for fraud or risk signals collection from the Wallet Units or making them available to Relying Parties such as PSPs. Technically collection and delivery would be feasible and could be done at the Wallet Providers discretion, but the very intent of [European Digital Identity Regulation] to maximise privacy preservation in the EUDI ecosystem prevents this. Fraud signal detection for payment services is not in the ARF scope, and there is no intention to include a complete set of requirements related to this topic.  </p>
<h4 id="332-basic-security-posture-of-wallet-unit">3.3.2 Basic security posture of Wallet Unit</h4>
<p>Although complete fraud or risk signal collection is not in scope of the ARF, it is recommended for and in the interests of the Wallet Providers to keep an active understanding of individual Wallet Instances baseline security posture, if this can be done with a privacy-preserving approach. This offloads part of the detection tasks from PSPs when it comes to their regulatory tasks, and allows the Wallet Providers to take care of at-risk Wallet Instances through technical means: Although not monitored in runtime similar to the payment applications, the Wallet Instances with raised basic security posture level can be revoked at the Wallet Provider's earliest convenience (following at least the requirements set in the ARF <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2338-topic-38---wallet-unit-revocation">Topic 38</a>).</p>
<p>We suggest to add new high-level requirements on <strong>basic security posture monitoring</strong> for the Wallet Providers to <strong>check regularly a minimal set of security information about the Wallet Instance</strong> as part of the support and maintenance function.</p>
<p>A collection of fraud or risk signal related information is collected below to table 2., with indication whether the data should be collected under the proposed new HLRs on basic security posture monitoring.</p>

<p>Table 2. Information typically screened to execute fraud signal analysis</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Is detection of incognito mode usage on browser relevant (and even possible) on the Wallet Instance - Wallet Provider or Wallet Instance - Wallet-relying Party transaction contexts? </p>
<p><strong>Question 3</strong>: What risks are present in incognito mode use?</p>
<p>Several of the signals are related to User behaviour patterns and thus will have no real value to the Wallet Provider (to conclude on the security posture of the User's device). Taking into account this aspect, as well as expectation of strict Wallet User privacy preservation with their use of a Wallet Solution, it seems the minimal additional list of security posture information (compared to table 1 earlier) to be checked is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>device rooting/jailbreaking detection</li>
<li>emulator detection</li>
<li>incognito mode detection (preliminary, pending conclusions of Questions 2 and 3 above)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wallet Provider should therefore build software analysis mechanisms that allow detection of changes in basic security posture of a Wallet Unit. In case of <strong>raised risk</strong> the Wallet Provider shall disable the Wallet Instance from conducting transactions. The minimum mechanism specified by the ARF is revocation of the Wallet Unit Attestation (WUA) within 24 hours from identifying a risk. The Wallet Providers may have also other (more real-time) tools to disable a Wallet Unit when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4</strong>: When trying to identify a raised security posture risk - where is the borderline that triggers revocation of in, is it up to the Wallet Provider to decide, or shall this be standardised for all Wallet Providers?</p>
<p>The new HLRs are proposed in Section 4 below.</p>
