<h1 id="topic-n-export-and-data-portability">Topic N - Export and data portability</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper Topic Description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group regarding Topic N: Export and data portability (Article 5a(4)(f) and Article 5a(4)(g)).</p>
<p>The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p><em>Requirements on the export and data portability functionalities supported by all Wallet Solutions is needed when source and target Wallet Instance are managed by the same of by different Wallet Providers.</em></p>
<h3 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key Words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and options specified in this document.
In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document Structure</h3>
<p>The document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 presents the legal requirements for functionality related to the export and portability of User's data from a Wallet Unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 3 presents and discusses a list of identified issues, with suggested changes and/or new High-Level Requirements related to this topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 4 presents a log of the additions and changes that will be made to High Level Requirements in the ARF as a result of discussing this topic with the Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 5 refers to other topics related to User's data export and portability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 6 presents the additions and changes that will be made to the ARF main document as a result of discussions. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-for-export-and-data-portability">2 Legal Requirements for Export and Data Portability</h2>
<p>Two legal texts impose direct requirements on Users's data export and portability: [European Digital Identity Regulation] and  <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2979/oj/eng">[CIR 2024/2979]</a> as regards the integrity and core functionalities of European Digital Identity Wallets. </p>
<p>This section recaps the respective legal requirements from these sources.</p>
<h3 id="21-european-digital-identity-regulation-about-data-export-and-portability">2.1  [European Digital Identity Regulation] about Data Export and Portability</h3>
<p>The [European Digital Identity Regulation] requires that the Wallet Units enable their Users to:
+ download the User’s data, electronic attestation of attributes and configurations (if technically possible),
+ import data to another Wallet Unit (portability),
+ all above performed in a User-friendly, transparent and traceable manner.</p>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the Regulation, including the recitals and the articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (48)</strong></p>
<p><em>This Regulation should foster choice and the possibility of switching between European Digital Identity Wallets where a Member State has endorsed more than one European Digital Identity Wallet solution on its territory. In order to avoid lock-in effects in such situations, where technically feasible, the providers of European Digital Identity Wallets should ensure the effective portability of data at the request of European Digital Identity Wallet users, and should not be allowed to use contractual, economic or technical barriers to prevent or to discourage effective switching between different European Digital Identity Wallets.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5a</strong></p>
<p><em>4. European Digital Identity Wallets shall enable the User, in a manner that is User-friendly, transparent, and traceable by the User, to:</em></p>
<p><em>[...]</em></p>
<p><em>(f) download, to the extent technically feasible, the User’s data, electronic attestation of attributes and configurations;</em></p>
<p><em>(g) exercise the user’s rights to data portability.</em></p>
<h3 id="22-cir-20242979-about-data-export-and-portability">2.2 [CIR 2024/2979] about Data Export and Portability</h3>
<p>The current version of the [CIR 2024/2979] specifies the following requirements related to User's data export and portability:
+ the Wallet Unit stores User's data - personal data, as well as transacion data (that shall be logged), 
+  the Wallet Unit shall allow extracting and exporting (dowloading) the User's data from a Wallet Unit, to the extent of technical feasiblity (with exception of critical assets),
+ the Wallet Unit shall allow the wallet User to import User's data exported from another Wallet Unit (also from other Wallet provider),
+ the data should be protected in all steps (storage, export, import) to preserve integrity, authenticity and confidentiality,
+ the migration process from one Wallet Unit to another one should ensure level of assurance high,
+ the same technical solutions are recommended to be used to allow also implementing backup and recovery processes for Wallet Units.</p>
<p>Below are selected excerpts from the [CIR 2024/2979], including the recitals and the articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (13)</strong></p>
<p><em>Data export and portability objects can log the person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes that have been issued to a particular wallet unit. These objects allow wallet users to extract the relevant data from their wallet unit in order to strengthen their right to data portability.</em> </p>
<p><em>Wallet providers are encouraged to use the same technical solutions to also implement backup and recovery processes for wallet units, making it possible to recover lost wallet units or to transfer information from one wallet provider to another, where appropriate and insofar as this can be done without impairing the right to data protection and the security of the digital identity ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 9</strong></p>
<p><em>Transaction logs</em></p>
<p><em>1. Irrespective of whether or not a transaction is successfully completed, wallet instances shall log all transactions with wallet-relying parties and other wallet units, including electronic signing and sealing.</em></p>
<p><em>2. The logged information shall at least contain:</em></p>
<p><em>(a) the time and date of the transaction;</em></p>
<p><em>(b) the name, contact details, and the unique identifier of the corresponding wallet-relying party and the Member State in which that wallet-relying party is established, or in case of other wallet units, relevant information from the wallet unit attestation;</em></p>
<p><em>(c) the type or types of data requested and presented in the transaction;</em></p>
<p><em>(d) in the case of non-completed transactions, the reason for such non-completion.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Wallet providers shall ensure integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the logged information.</em></p>
<p><em>7. Wallet providers shall enable wallet users to export the logged information referred to in paragraph 2.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 13</strong></p>
<p><em>Data export and portability</em></p>
<p><em>Wallet units shall, where technically feasible and excepting cases of critical assets, support secure export and portability of personal data of the wallet user, to allow the wallet user to migrate to a wallet unit of a different wallet solution in a way that ensures level of assurance high as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-discussion">3 Discussion</h2>
<p>The implementing act [CIR 2024/2979] has been adopted and the ARF document has been aligned with the act in earlier stage, thus there are no identified discrepancies or major issues. Therefore this paper presents and clarifies the overall concept and technical assumptions and aims to collect feedback if there is a need of any improvements of HLR from the Member States and Coordination Group point of view.</p>
<p>The topics identified for this paper are as follows:
+ scope of data to be logged by the Wallet Unit and the log format,
+ possible extent of data export from a Wallet Unit,
+ usability of a Wallet Unit after the data import process,
+ involvement of the PID and Attestation Providers in the Wallet Unit migration and recovery process,
+ terminology.</p>
<p>This document is ONLY intended to clarify the high-level requirements related to the export and data portability topic. The necessary technical specifications (including any policy documents) will be developed by the European Commission after an agreement on the requirements has been reached.</p>
<h3 id="31-data-export">3.1 Data Export</h3>
<p>The Article 5a of [European Digital Identity Regulation] requires from the Wallets to enable to </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>download, to the extent technically feasible, the User’s data, electronic attestation of attributes and configurations</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>as well as in Article 13 of [CIR 2024/2979]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>where technically feasible and excepting cases of critical assets, support secure export and portability of personal data of the wallet user, to allow the wallet user to migrate to a wallet unit of a different wallet solution in a way that ensures level of assurance high as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The technically feasible extent of the User's data export is therefore limited for security reasons. </p>
<p>The ARF is in line with this. In the current version of ARF it is assumed that private keys of PIDs and Attestations are not exportable (and not a part of the so called Migration Object). In consequence, the migration process always entails the issuance of new PIDs and Attestations of Attributes actually (see section 3.2). </p>
<p>Therefore, there are no identified HLRs modifications in this respect. </p>
<h3 id="32-technical-feasibility-of-portability-and-migration">3.2 Technical Feasibility of Portability and Migration</h3>
<p>The requirements set out in the Topic 34 of ARF define so called Migration Object, that contains a set of data - User's personal and transaction log data - ready to be exported from a Wallet Unit and imported into another one.</p>
<p>This is to be noted that the Migration Object does not contain PID and attestations related private keys, and therefore the migration process requires issuance of new PID/Attestations (of the same type), with the involvement of the PID / Attestation Providers and User authentication.</p>
<p>From the Topic 34 'Description' section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note that the Migration Object does not contain any private keys associated with the PIDs or attestations. In most security architectures for a Wallet Solution described in Section 4.5 of the ARF main document, this is impossible, since the WSCA/WSCD that contains these private keys does not allow their extraction under any circumstances.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process might be however different if the keys are stored in a remote HSM (as the further text in the 'Description'): </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An exception may be architectures in which attestation private keys are managed in a remote HSM and the migration is to a new Wallet Unit of the same Wallet Provider. However, in such cases, restoring functionality of the PIDs and attestations in a new Wallet Unit does not necessitate that private keys must be exported to another HSM. Rather, it implies the User must be able to authenticate towards the existing HSM from the new Wallet Unit, and be recognised as an existing User.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, regardless the architecture, this is assumed that the Migration Object's role is only to facilitate the migration process, i.a. give a list of PIDs and attributes, so that can be re-issued in a new Wallet Unit. </p>
<p>Finally</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The fact that the Migration Object does not contain private keys means that PIDs and attestations cannot be backed up and restored from the object in such a way that they are usable in a new Wallet Unit without involvement of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider. Instead, the User must ask the respective PID Provider(s) or Attestation Provider(s) to re-issue the PID(s) or attestation(s) to the new Wallet Unit. The only function of the Migration Object is to simplify this process by listing the PIDs and attestations present in the existing Wallet Unit, together with the information needed by the new Wallet Unit to start the re-issuance process.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, there are no modifications of HLR in relation to the essence.</p>
<p>There are however minor corrections proposed to Mig_01 and Mig_05. </p>
<p>For Mig_01, it is to clarify that the WUAs are not part of the migration object (as considered as not "User's data" as such) </p>

<h3 id="33-recovery-of-lost-wallet-units">3.3 Recovery of Lost Wallet Units</h3>
<p>The recovery of a lost Wallet Unit follows the same process and the same limitations as for the migration process apply (see section 3.2).</p>
<h3 id="34-scope-of-logged-information">3.4 Scope of Logged Information</h3>
<p>Article 9(2) of [CIR 2024/2979] specifies the scope of data to be logged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The logged information shall at least contain: (a) the time and date of the transaction; (b) the name, contact details, and the unique identifier of the corresponding wallet-relying party and the Member State in which that wallet-relying party is established, or in case of other wallet units, relevant information from the wallet Unit attestation; (c) the type or types of data requested and presented in the transaction; (d) in the case of non-completed transactions, the reason for such non-completion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ARF defines the scope of information to be logged as:
+ all types of transaction executed through the Wallet Unit: issuance and re-issuance transactions, presentation transactions, signature and seal creation transactions, attribute deletion requests sent to a Relying Party, and complaints lodged with a Data Protection Authority (DASH_02, DASH_2a, DASH_03, DASH_04, DASH_05, Mig_01),
+ transactions related to qualified electronic signatures and seals generated by or through the Wallet Unit (QES_13),
+ reports sent to the DPA (RPT_DPA_05),
+ attribute deletion requests (DATA_DLT_05, DATA_DLT_06).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ARF is in line with the regulatory requirements in principle.</p>
<p>However it is proposed to specify in the scope of logged information also the following cases:
+ PID/attestation deletion events (--&gt; changes proposed in DASH_02), 
+ other events possibly that will be relevant following the development of the ARF (eg. in relation to Topic W --&gt; apropriate clauses on logging will be proposed as a part of the Topic W discussion outcome and HLR set, that is yet to come).</p>
<p>In addition, the following minor changes have been proposed, to improve consistency of the text: </p>

<p>Additionally, to improve clarity, there are ongoing changes that will be introduced in the next ARF realease in relation to DASH_03, DASH_04, DASH_05 (to state it more clearly that these information are logged).</p>
<h3 id="35-log-format">3.5 Log format</h3>
<p>To enable migration between Wallet Units from different Wallet Solutions/Wallet Providers, the log format should be specified in a Technical Specification. Therefore it is proposed to add a new HLR, as below:</p>

<th><strong>Proposal</strong></th>

<td>New requirement</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="36-terminology">3.6 Terminology</h3>
<p>In the context of Topic N, the term "re-issuance" is used. As presented in this paper, it refers to the situation of migration, which actually entails process of issuance of new PIDs and attestations (of the same type), in a new Wallet Unit, like for the first time provisioning (which i.a. requires User authentication prior the issuance).  </p>
<p>This term however is already used in the context of Topic B (Re-issuance and batch issuance of PIDs and Attestations), where it refers to a different process - replacement of a PID or Attestations that already exists in a Wallet Unit, performed by the same PID Provider or Attestation Provider that issued them, in a process that is transparent for the User as much as possible (e.g. avoiding authentication of the User possibly). </p>
<p>Therefore this is proposed not to use this term in the context of Topic N. As a consequence, modifications of a some HLRs are proposed (Mig_03, Mig_11), as presented in the section 4.  </p>
<h2 id="4-current-hlrs-and-proposals-of-changes">4 Current HLRs and Proposals of Changes</h2>

<p>There were several changes introduced to the Topic C (and the related ARF Annex II [Topic 9]) in the earlier stages of the ARF work (see the <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework-private/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/c-wallet-unit-attestation.md">Topic C Discussion Paper</a>, resulting in reduction and simplification of the requirments. </p>
