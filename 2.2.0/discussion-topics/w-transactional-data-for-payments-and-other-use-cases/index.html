<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-for-transactional-data-for-payments-and-other-use-cases">2 Legal Requirements for Transactional Data for payments and other use cases</h2>
<p>The [European Digital Identity Regulation] requires the Wallets to support and provide a function of strong user authentication, that could be used to authenticate the User accessing or using an online service that requires identification and strong authentication (by EU or local law or by contractual obligation).
The online services might be of any type, provided by public or private Service Providers, in particular from  the areas of transport, energy, banking, financial services, social security, health, drinking water, postal services, digital infrastructure, education or telecommunications (but not limited to these ones only).</p>
<p>Therefore the Wallet Solutions should provide functionality that enable wallet-Relying Parties (which are the Service Providers) to use the Wallets as an external tool of User authentication.</p>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the Regulation, including the recitals and the articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (62)</strong></p>
<p><em>Secure electronic identification and the provision of attestation of attributes should offer additional flexibility and solutions for the financial services sector to allow the identification of customers and the exchange of specific attributes necessary to comply with, for example, customer due diligence requirements under a future Regulation establishing the Anti Money Laundering Authority, with suitability requirements stemming from investor protection law, or to support the fulfilment of strong customer authentication requirements for online identification for the purposes of account login and of initiation of transactions in the field of payment services.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 3 (Definitions)</strong></p>
<p>(51) <em>'strong user authentication' means an authentication based on the use of at least two authentication factors from different categories of either knowledge, something only the user knows, possession, something only the user possesses or inherence, something the user is, that are independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, and is designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data;</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5f(2)</strong>
<em>Where private relying parties that provide services, with the exception of microenterprises and small enterprises as defined in Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, are required by Union or national law to use strong user authentication for online identification or where strong user authentication for online identification is required by contractual obligation, including in the areas of transport, energy, banking, financial services, social security, health, drinking water, postal services, digital infrastructure, education or telecommunications, those private relying parties shall, no later than 36 months from the date of entry into force of the implementing acts referred to in Article 5a(23) and Article 5c(6) and only upon the voluntary request of the user, also accept European Digital Identity Wallets that are provided in accordance with this Regulation.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-discussion">3 Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="31-introduction">3.1 Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="311-the-use-cases">3.1.1 The Use Cases</h4>
<p>The European Digital Identity Regulation requires the Wallets to provide a functionality of strong authentication of a User, to play a role of an authenticator for various services, while the Service Providers are obliged to accept them in their (online) services. Consequently, to enable such processes, the Wallet Units should be able to handle transactional data related to an (external) service and a transaction, to enable required functionality, provide a proof of transaction and auditability, as well as ensure compliance with other regulations where necessary (like Payment Services related legislation). </p>
<p>In addition, the Wallet is supposed to provide the functionality of a Qualified Electronic Signature. In case of remote QES, the Wallet can play a role of a tool to activate (authorise) signature creation in a remote signing service.  </p>
<p>Therefore, despite there might be many use cases where there will be no need to involve "transactional data", at least for the following use cases it is necessary to do so:
+ payments authentication,
+ remote qualified electronic signature.   </p>
<p>In this paper we focus on the use cases where transactional data is involved. </p>
<p>At the same time, [OID4VP] provides so called "transaction data" mechanism that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>enables a binding between the User's identification/authentication and the user’s authorization, for example to complete a payment transaction, or to sign specific document(s) using QES (Qualified Electronic Signatures)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mechanism seems to be suitable for the purpose of handling the transactional data. Similarly, the [ISO/IEC 18013-5] protocol payload is also able to bear transactional data if needed.</p>
<h4 id="312-the-role-of-the-wallet">3.1.2 The Role of the Wallet</h4>
<p>In general the life cycle of a Wallet Unit in the role of an authenticator, comprises the following phases:
+ registration - registering the Wallet as an authenticator for a service, that includes User identification and authentication, User consent (for the registration) and linking a Wallet Unit with a service and User's account in that service,
+ authentication - performing User authentication in an on-line service, on request of that service,
+ de-registration - unlinking the Wallet Unit from a service and the User's account in that service.</p>
<p>As the result of registration, a specific Attestation ("service credentials") is issued by the Service Provider or other Wallet-Relying Party (depending on the scheme) to the Wallet Unit. The registration relies on the standard Attestation issuance processes, and the data included in this Attestation are defined by the Service Provider.</p>
<p>In the authentication phase, the Wallet Unit will receive the presentation request of the "service credentials". The presentation is a standard process for the Wallet User, however the request should include transactional data (unique for each service transaction).
In some cases, like payment authentication, the Wallet Unit should display to the User (some) transaction related data (that should be inlcuded in the transactional data).</p>
<p>After the User accepts the presentation request, the Wallet response should include the transactional data, as well as piece of data generated dynamically by the Wallet Unit, for each such presentation, to provide a proof of the User's approval and meet compliance needs where necessary (eg. PSD2 dynamic linking). </p>
<h4 id="313-the-goals-of-the-discussion">3.1.3 The Goals of the Discussion</h4>
<p>The goal of the discussion is to work out a set of generic HLRs that are not tied to any specific use case, unless justified. The intention is to keep the Wallet's role as limited as possible - just as an enabler of the use cases. </p>
<p>The legal text sets out the requirement to use the Wallet as a strong authenticator in the context of "online services". However ARF envisions transactions initiated in/from the same Wallet Unit or by another device in proximity mode. </p>
<p>To summarise, there are several fundamental questions to be discussed and answered before proposing the set of HLRs. These questions are presented in the next sections.</p>
<p>Note: This document is ONLY intended to clarify or create the high-level requirements related to this topic. The necessary technical specifications (including any policy documents) will be developed by the European Commission after an agreement on the requirements has been reached.</p>
<h3 id="32-question-for-discussion">3.2 Question for Discussion</h3>
<p>Here below is the list of the fundamental questions that needs answering prior to drafting HLRs.</p>
<p>As the outcome:
+ the set of new HLRs requirements is to be delivered in the ARF Annex 2 for [Topic 20] (Strong User authentication for electronic payments),
+ new Topics may be introduced in the ARF Annex 2 (to cover non-payment use cases),
+ modification or amendments of other HLRs and Topics may be proposed.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Are rules for representing the contents of a transaction necessary and if so, who should specify these? </p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Should it be possible to send a transaction to/from one Wallet User to another Wallet User?  </p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Should it be possible for a Wallet-Relying Party to define the structure and contents of a transaction? </p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Should it be possible to define the structure and contents of a transaction type for a business area such as payments? </p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> If transactions types are defined for a business area, who should be responsible for defining and maintaining these? </p>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> Should it be possible for a EUDI Wallet to process a transaction in a structured way? </p>
<p><strong>Question 7:</strong> Is a transaction restricted to authentication and authorization? </p>
<p><strong>Question 8:</strong> Should it be possible to include the actual contents in a transaction or should it be a representation (hash) of it?  </p>
<p><strong>Question 9:</strong> What is the minimum set of information to be specified for a transaction? </p>
<p><strong>Question 10:</strong> Should batch transactions be supported? </p>
<p><strong>Question 11:</strong> What are the requirements for the proof of transaction?</p>
<p><strong>Question 12:</strong> Are there / what are the requirements to ensure a transaction is processed only once?</p>
<p><strong>Question 13:</strong> Should a log of all transactions carried out through the European Digital Identity Wallet be accessible via a common dashboard?</p>
<p>On the basis of the discussion and the feedback from Member States' representatives, the High-Level Requirements have been proposed as specified in the section 4.</p>
<h2 id="4-current-hlrs-and-proposals-of-changes">4 Current HLRs and Proposals of Changes</h2>
<p>The topics of the ARF Annex 2 related to the Topic W are the following:
+ Topic 20 - Strong User authentication for electronic payments,
+ Topic 16 - Signing documents with a Wallet Unit.</p>
<p>Topic 20 does not have any requirements yet, so the set of new ones is proposed in the section 4.1.</p>
<p>The HLRs set out in the Topic 16 have been reviewed too, however no changes have been identified as necessary from the Topic W perspective.</p>
