The latter is undergoing changes due to consultation process, and thus this document may need modification after the publication and approval of the final CIR.</h3>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper Topic Description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group regarding Topic X: Relying Party registration.
The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p><em>This topic is to gather High level Requirements (HLR) for Relying Party registration. The HLR relate to information necessary for authentication to access European Digital Identity Wallets, and to relying parties’ contact details and their intended use of wallets, including what data relying parties may ask users for</em>.</p>
<h3 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key Words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and options specified in this document.
In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document Structure</h3>
<p>The document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 presents the legal requirements for functionality related to the Relying Party registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 3 presents and discusses a list of identified issues, with suggested changes and/or new High-Level Requirements related to this topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 4 presents a log of the additions and changes that will be made to High Level Requirements in the ARF as a result of discussing this topic with Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 5 refers to other topics related to Relying Party registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 6 presents the additions and changes that will be made to the ARF main document as a result of discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-for-relying-party-registration">2 Legal Requirements for Relying Party registration</h2>
<p>Two legal texts impose direct requirements on the Relying Party registration: The evolving <a href="https://tinyurl.com/IA-5b-draft">Draft of the CIR for RP-Registration</a> and the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. This section recaps the respective legal requirements from these sources.</p>
<h3 id="21-european-digital-identity-regulation-about-relying-party-registration">2.1 [European Digital Identity Regulation] about Relying Party registration</h3>
<p>The [European Digital Identity Regulation] requires the Relying Parties to be registered. It specifies the following requirements related to Relying Party registration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up national registers of registered wallet-relying parties in each Member State</li>
<li>Registering Relying Party needs to provide at minimum, a definite set of information necessary to authenticate to EUDI Wallets including the intended use and indication of data requested for this use from the user</li>
<li>Relying Parties shall only request data that is registered for the intended use</li>
<li>Member States shall make the Relying Party register information available to the public in a manner that is both human and machine-readable</li>
<li>Member States shall provide a common mechanism for authenticating the Relying Parties in the European Digital Identity ecosystem</li>
<li>An Intermediary that is acting on behalf of relying parties is deemed to be a Relying Party, but shall not store data exchanged between the EUDI Wallet user and intermediated Relying Party</li>
<li>The European Commission shall establish technical specifications and procedures to support the registration process, publication of the registries, updates of registration information by means of implementing acts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the Regulation, including the recitals and the Articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (17)</strong></p>
<p><em>For the purposes of registration, relying parties should provide the information necessary to allow for their electronic identification and authentication towards European Digital Identity Wallets. When declaring their intended use of the European Digital Identity Wallet, relying parties should provide information regarding the data that they will request, if any, in order to provide their services and the reason for the request.
Relying party registration facilitates the verification by Member States with regard to the lawfulness of the activities of the relying parties in accordance with Union law. The obligation to register provided for in this Regulation should be without prejudice to obligations laid down in other Union or national law, such as the information to be provided to the data subjects pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Relying parties should comply with the safeguards offered by Articles 35 and 36 of that Regulation, in particular by performing data protection impact assessments and by consulting the competent data protection authorities prior to data processing where data protection impact assessments indicate that the processing would result in a high risk. Such safeguards should support the lawful processing of personal data by relying parties, in particular with regard to special categories of data, such as health data. The registration of relying parties is intended to enhance transparency and trust in the use of European Digital Identity Wallets.
Registration should be cost-effective and proportionate to the related risks in order to ensure uptake by service providers. In that context, registration should provide for the use of automated procedures, including the reliance on and the use of existing registers by Member States, and should not entail a pre-authorisation process.
The registration process should enable a variety of use-cases that can differ in terms of mode of operation, whether online or in offline mode, or in terms of the requirement to authenticate devices for the purposes of interfacing with the European Digital Identity Wallet.
Registration should apply exclusively to relying parties providing services by means of digital interaction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (18)</strong></p>
<p><em>Safeguarding Union citizens and residents in the Union against the unauthorised or fraudulent use of European Digital Identity Wallets is of high importance for ensuring trust in and for the wide uptake of European Digital Identity Wallets. Users should be provided with effective protection against such misuse. In particular, when facts that form the basis for fraudulent or otherwise illegal use of a European Digital Identity Wallet are established by a national judicial authority in the context of another procedure, supervisory bodies that are responsible for European Digital Identity Wallet issuers should, upon notification, take the necessary measures to ensure that the registration of the relying party and the inclusion of relying parties in the authentication mechanism are withdrawn or suspended until the notifying authority confirms that the irregularities identified have been remedied.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 3</strong></p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p><em>‘relying party’ means a natural or legal person that relies upon electronic identification, European Digital Identity Wallets or other electronic identification means, or upon a trust service;</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5b - European Digital Identity Wallet-Relying Parties</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Where a relying party intends to rely upon European Digital Identity Wallets</em>
<em>for the provision of public or private services by means of digital</em>
<em>interaction, the relying party shall register in the Member State where it is</em>
<em>established.</em></li>

<p>Below are selected excerpts from the public consultation [Draft of the CIR for RP-Registration], including the recitals and the Articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Member States should establish and maintain registers of registered wallet-relying parties established in their territory.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (4)</strong></p>
<p><em>In order to facilitate the consultation of the information on registered wallet-relying parties across the Union, Member States should make this information available to the public in a manner that is both human and machine-readable.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (6)</strong></p>
<p><em>As registration policies are a useful tool for providing clear guidance to the wallet-relying parties on the registration process, Member States should set out and publish the registration policies applicable to registers set up in their territory.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (7)</strong></p>
<p><em>[...] another objective of the relying party registration is to facilitate the verification by Member States of the lawfulness of the activities of the wallet-relying parties. Therefore, wallet-relying parties should provide, for inclusion in the registers the necessary information, including their entitlement(s).</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (8)</strong></p>
<p><em>In order to ensure that the registration process is cost-effective and proportionate-to risk, and to strike an appropriate balance between meeting a high level of transparency and safety on the one hand and ensuring uptake by service providers on the other hand, registrars should set up online and, where applicable, automated registration processes for wallet-relying parties that are easy to use and they should verify applications for registration without undue delay.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (10)</strong></p>
<p><em>[...] wallet-relying parties should use wallet-relying party access certificates when they identify themselves to wallet units. To guarantee interoperability of those certificates across all wallets provided within the Union, wallet-relying parties access certificates should adhere to common requirements set-out in the Annex to this Regulation</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (11)</strong></p>
<p><em>[...] wallet-relying parties are not to request users to provide any data other than those indicated for the intended use of wallets during the registration process. Wallet users should be enabled to verify the registration data of wallet-relying parties. To enable wallet users to verify that the attributes being requested by the wallet-relying party are within the scope of their registered attributes, Member States may require the issuance of wallet-relying party registration certificates to registered wallet-relying parties. To ensure the interoperability of the wallet-relying party registration certificates, Member States should ensure that those certificates meet the requirements and standards set out in the Annex of this Implementing Regulation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (12)</strong>
<em>[...] registrars should be able to suspend or cancel the registration of any wallet-relying party without prior notice where the registrars have reason to believe that the registration contains information which is not accurate, not up to date or misleading, the wallet-relying party is not compliant with the registration policy or the wallet-relying party is otherwise acting in breach of Union or national law in a way that relates to their role as a wallet-relying party. In order to safeguard the stability of the wallet ecosystem, the decision to suspend or cancel a registration should be proportionate to the service disruption caused by the suspension or cancellation and the associated cost and inconvenience for the service provider and the user. For the same reason, supervisory bodies are to be enabled to suspend and cancel the registration required pursuant to Article 46a(4), point (f) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.</em></p>

<h2 id="3-discussion">3 Discussion</h2>
<p>The Relying Party registration covers from functional perspective of the ARF and the European Digital Identity ecosystem the following aspects: </p>
<p>1) the <strong>Registrar function</strong> for which the Member States are responsible to organise this function, register and a publicly accessible API at a national level (based on the future technical specifications and the CIR provided by the European Commission),
2) the registration process mandated to be be followed by all Relying Parties resulting in issuance of one or more <strong>Wallet-Relying Party Access Certificates</strong> (RPAC) and as many <strong>Wallet-Relying Party Registration Certificates</strong> (RPRC) as the Relying Party has dedicated intended uses (use cases, services provided to the EUDI Wallet Users),
3) the <strong>operational use of aforementioned certificates</strong> in Relying Party transactions with the EUDI Wallet Units and their Users,
4) <strong>handling the functional revocation of Relying Party certificates</strong> as necessitated by the legal requirements, 
5) how the registration and operational use of the RP registration certificates shall be done when <strong>the Relying Party relies upon another Relying Party that is acting on its behalf (an intermediary)</strong> to provide its intended use towards the Wallet Units.</p>
<p>Having analysed the combined legal requirements, the current ARF (release 1.8), as well as recent German architecture concept proposals ([German non-paper on RP Authn], [German non-paper on WRP with attestations], that together contain considerable amount of technical detail and that were discussed indirectly in the context of topic D already), this section raises the following topics for discussion at level of High-Level Requirements relevant for the ARF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements needed to support registrar issuance of RP registration certificates for proximity use cases, not just remote (specifically, support of both JWT and CWT formats of the RP registration certificates, support of both JOSE and COSE signature)</li>
<li>Requirements impacted from the fact that the Relying Party has an access certificate per Relying Party Instance (either in remote or proximity scenarios)</li>
<li>Requirements impacted from the fact that registration certificates are issued per each registered intended use of the Relying Party</li>
<li>Changes needed in the ARF due to earlier assumption that PID or Attestation Providers did not need a Relying Party registration certificate</li>
<li>Identified HLR changes due to clarification of the role of intermediaries (adaptation of the certificate usage to the role  of intermediaries and the related processes, e.g. registration process and RP registration certificate content if issued to an intermediary, and binding association between the access certificate of the intermediary and the registration certificates of its End-Relying Parties)  </li>
<li>Modification related to distinguishing between lifecycle of the RP registration and the lifecycle of RPRC itself, as well as the relation between them (e.g. adapt the HLRs to the fact that certificates can only be revoked (no suspension), while the registration can be cancelled or suspended)  </li>
<li>Other terminology mismatches that need alignment between the draft IA and the ARF (eg. registration 'withdrawal' to be replaced with 'cancellation').</li>
<li>Necessary adaptation of registration policy, certification policy and certification policy statement requirements in line with conclusions on the above issues</li>
<li>Impacts on the HLRs under other Topics of ARF Annex 2 (Topic 6 &amp; Topic 31, at least)</li>
</ul>
<p>This document is ONLY intended to clarify the high-level requirements related to the Relying Party registration topic. The necessary technical specifications (including any policy documents) will be developed by the European Commission after agreement over the requirements has been reached.</p>
<h3 id="31-proximity-use-case-support">3.1 Proximity use case support</h3>
<p>The Annex IV and V of the [Draft CIR on Relying Party registration] will bind legally what certificate standards are applicable for the RPAC and RPRC to be issued by the registrar. Use of the RPRC in context of proximity use case is mentioned in the ARF indirectly in (6.6.3.5), but necessary technical requirements for RPRC issuance are pointing at use of JOSE for signing/sealing the certificate, and the data format of the certificate contents being JSON (Annex V of the draft CIR). Requirement for the Registrar to support provisioning of registration certificates in both JWT and CWT format was agreed to be added to the requirements.</p>
<p>A new HLR is proposed to extend the scope of registration to apply over both online and proximity use cases:</p>

<td>New</td>

<h3 id="32-access-certificates-with-multiple-relying-party-instances">3.2 Access certificates with multiple Relying Party instances</h3>
<p>When addressing the RPACs, the Regulation does not recognise the need for multiple instances of Relying Party services in modern IT architectures (replication of RP servers and common dependance on multiple geographical cloud provider regions to ensure availability and continuity of RP services). Multi-instance Relying Parties will also be commonplace in proximity use cases with handheld or mounted verification devices interacting with the Wallet Units. The fact that multiple access certificates with individual private keys can be requested and issued by the Access Certificate Authorities should be clarified in the ARF requirements on registering access certificates, and in the policy documents to be created based on the ARF high-level requirements.</p>
<p>The HLR Reg_15 on policy for revocation is revised to mention multiple RPACs (<em>all</em> RPACS of a Relying Party), and a new HLR Reg_15b is brought to clarify the need for controlled revocation of individual instance RPACs (when the Relying Party still has at least one or more valid RPACs after revoking one or more RPACs assigned to its Relying Party Instances). Related to the existing HLRs on relying party access certificates Reg_31 and Reg_32, the requirements with their contextual notes should be moved under Topic 44 with rewording to mean RPRCs. To ensure binding of the RPAC and RPRC with the unique identifier of the Relying Party, a new HLR Reg_33 is introduced.</p>

<h3 id="33-registration-certificate-per-intended-use">3.3 Registration certificate per intended use</h3>
<p>The Relying Party registration requires Relying Parties to provide information necessary for authentication, their contact details, and the intended use of the European Digital Identity Wallets, including the specific data they will request from users. The RPAC (wallet Relying Party Access Certificate) authenticates who the Relying Party is, while the RPRC (wallet-Relying Party Registration Certificate) specifies what data that authenticated the Relying Party is entitled to request for a particular registered purpose (intended use). Crucially, Relying Parties are explicitly prohibited from requesting any data beyond what is indicated in their registration. This is a key mechanism for enforcing data minimisation and purpose limitation.</p>
<p>According to the [Draft CIR on Relying Party registration] a Relying Party will get issued a unique RPRC for each of its registered intended uses, and these registration certificates may be revoked independent of each other or of the associated RPAC. The access certificates are the Relying Party's 'master switches' to the EUDI ecosystem, whilst registration certificates are used to register and document the use case/s provided to the Wallet User. The registration certificate will not be a X.509 certificate, and thus the required certificate policies for RPRCs should be clarified both in the IA draft and the ARF. </p>
<p>Current RPRC_2 and RPC_3 in the ARF should be updated to reflect the text of the draft CIR on RPR, a new requirement on use of unique RP identifier across the RPRCs, and a new HLR on creating applicable certificate policies is suggested for Topic 44 as follows:</p>

<h3 id="34-addressing-the-pid-providers-and-attestation-providers-on-rprcs">3.4 Addressing the PID Providers and Attestation Providers on RPRCs</h3>
<p>The [Draft of the CIR for RP-Registration] implies that among all other roles defined in the ARF also the PID Providers and Attestation Providers will receive registration certificates, with the role registered as part of the registration and reflected in the certificate information (the specific entitlement being one or more of the set PID_Provider, QEAA_Provider, Non_Q_EAA_Provider or PUB_EAA_Provider). This needs to be reflected in the ARF, which so far has separated these roles from the Relying Parties (per definition of the ARF).</p>
<p>Section 6.3.2.2 of the ARF says that "<em>A PID Provider access certificate indicates that its subject is a PID Provider. Similarly, an Attestation Provider access certificate indicates that its subject is a QEAA Provider, a PuB-EAA Provider or a non-qualified EAA Provider.</em>"</p>
<p>This is not the case per the draft CIR, the entitlements indicating the registered role are only present in the Relying Party registration certificate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the definition set in the ARF needs to be adapted or extended accordingly, and Reg_17 on list of HLRs for the issuance of access certificates should be removed (entitlements not being present in access certificates):</p>

<h4 id="351-registration-on-behalf-of-the-end-relying-parties">3.5.1 Registration on-behalf of the End-Relying Parties</h4>
<p>The intention reflected in the [Draft of the CIR for RP-Registration] is that the intermediaries are to receive the RPRC of their End-Relying Parties. If an End-Relying Party uses an intermediary, it (the End-RP) will not need to itself apply or receive its Wallet-Relying Party certificate from the Registrar, if the intermediary (as part of their service towards the End-Relying Parties) registers for it and possesses the RPRCs for all of its customers. This will simplify the process of End-Relying Parties, who can This model is not mandated by the ARF, the processes how registration will be organised in Member States is left for national discretion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The means to indicate to the national registry/ies that an entity is registering as an Intermediary is left for national discretion (see RPI_04), there is no such role/entitlement recognised in the Regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pure intermediary will upon its registration receive only RPACs listing its own unique Relying Party identifier and (common) name. The intermediated End-Relying Parties are not provided RPACs, and their set of issued RPRCs are hosted by their intermediary. It is not in the scope of the ARF to cover how the intended use specific RPRCs are to be managed between the End-Relying Party and the Intermediary.</p>
<p>As the intermediaries are acting on behalf of the End-Relying Parties, and will remain liable towards the Registrar on accuracy of the information to be registered, they must carry same identity proofing and data verification checks for their customers as the Registrar would do for the End-Relying Party in case of direct registration path. The Registrar shall also not trust blindly the Intermediary but execute the identity verification of both the Intermediary and the End-Relying Parties to be registered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Attention must be paid towards compliance of principles such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, storage limitation or accountability, and of requirements such as those related to data subject rights when using an Intermediary. The compliance against requirements of RPI_10 are therefore essential to be audited when defining the national registration and security policies for Intermediaries. There is no such intention from the Commission, as this (no EU-level policy setting) is already the case for the proxying TSPs since enforcement of (EU) 2014/910.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="352-use-of-certificates-upon-on-behalf-operation-towards-wallet-units">3.5.2 Use of certificates upon on-behalf operation towards Wallet Units</h4>
<p>When operating on behalf of its End-Relying Parties, the intermediary will possess as many RPRCs as number of its intermediated End-RPs entities (multiplied by the number of services/intended uses for each entity possibly). The ARF describes already how the certificates are to be used by the Intermediary and the Wallet Unit in RPI_06 to RPI_10. For clarity, the process of presenting the Intermediary RPAC and the End-Relying Party RPRC with necessary technical level binding is illustrated in Figure 1 below.</p>
<p><img alt="Intermediary-certificate-presentation-to-wu" src="../img/intermediary-certificate-presentation-to-wu.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 1 - Validation of identifiers between Intermediary RPAC and End-Relying Party RPRC.</p>
<p>The ARF (1.8) contains requirement RPI_02, assuming the intermediary does not receive registration certificates of its own, and this assumption remains valid unless the Relying Party acting as an intermediary has other wallet-relying party services with intended uses that invoke the duty to register an RPRC. </p>
<p>As summary, the ARF needs to be adapted to the intended role of the intermediaries as per the [Draft of the CIR for RP-Registration], which implies modifications of multiple HLRs. Below are the proposed changes to the key HRLs in this respect (other HLRs might need to be updated accordingly). </p>

<h3 id="36-registration-and-registration-certificate-life-cycles">3.6 Registration and Registration Certificate life cycles</h3>
<p>The Article 9 of [Draft of the CIR for RP-Registration]  envisions 'suspension' and 'cancellation' of the registration (apart from the non-specified "active" state after the registration). 
At the same time the RP registration certificate has its own life cycle, which envisions only 'revocation' (apart from the "valid" state after issuance).</p>
<p>In addition, the IA draft text lists the following reasons of suspension/cancellation:
+ the registration contains information which is inaccurate, out of date or misleading;
+ the wallet-relying party is not complying with the registration policy;
+ the wallet-relying party is requesting more attributes than they have registered; 
+ the wallet-relying party is otherwise acting in breach of Union or national law in a manner related to their role as wallet-relying party;
+ by a supervisory body European Digital Identity Wallet Framework in the case of illegal or fraudulent use of the European Digital Identity Wallet.</p>
<p>The technical specifications and policy documents that base their requirements on the ARF must specify the RPRC specific policies on lifecycle management (e.g., updates for and revocation of the existing RPRCs as indended uses and their data requirements change over time) and policies for eventual multi-registration (per intended use, per Member State) and cross-border registration. </p>
<p>Defined policies should also address how to execute post-registration analysis and audits against the registered intended uses, unless the audits are to be left entirely for the EUDI Wallet Unit level functions - such as already introduced in the ARF <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md#66313-wallet-unit-enables-the-user-to-report-suspicious-requests-by-a-relying-party-and-to-request-a-relying-party-to-erase-personal-data">Section 6.6.3.13</a>, and the functionalities to be defined via Topic M - User reporting unlawful or suspicious request of data to DPAs.</p>

The Wallet Unit notifies the User in case one or more of the requested attributes is not included in the list of attributes in the registration certificate.  The RPRC also contains the RP name and unique identifier, which is identical to the same data in the access cert.</td>
<td>6.4.2, 6.6.3.3, 6.6.3.5, Annex 2, Topic 6,  RPA_06, RPA_06a &amp; new RPA_06x HLRs needed</td>
<td>Need to define what the Wallet Unit needs to do in case no RPRC is present</td>
<td>1) The RP access cert SHALL always contain the URL of an end point of the Registrar that the Wallet Unit can use to obtain information about the Relying Party. 2) The Wallet Unit SHALL enable the User to specify that they want to do additional verifications of the RP. By default, the Wallet Unit SHALL NOT do this verification. The Wallet Unit SHALL make clear that these additional verifications may involve an online check of information at a Registrar. 3) If the User has indicated that they want to do the additional verifications: a. the Wallet Unit SHALL retrieve the RPRC from the presentation request if present and proceed as already described in the ARF; b. If the RPRC is not present, the Wallet Unit SHALL request the Registrar at the URL in point 1) for the list of registered attributes of the Relying Party, using the unique ID of the RP from its access certificate; c. The Wallet Unit SHALL notify the User about the outcome of the verification in case the RP requests attributes that it did not register. The Wallet Unit SHALL also notify the User in case the Wallet Unit was not able to retrieve the RPRC information. Otherwise (i.e., if everything is OK), a User notification is optional. <em>General notes: (i) This approach means that the level of privacy/security of the User (by carrying out the additional verifications) is not dependent on whether the MS that registered the RP has issued an RPRC. Rather, if the User chooses to, they are carried out, regardless of whether there is an RPRC in the presentation request. (ii) There are a couple of reasons for setting the default to not doing the additional verifications: RPRCs were envisioned to enable additional verifications of RPs, on top of the authentication enabled by the RP access certificate. Since RPRCs are now optional, the additional verifications enabled by the RPRC should be viewed as optional as well. These additional verifications should therefore be done only if the User explicitly requests them. In addition, to avoid possible performance issues at the Registrars. (iii) In the IA, there is no obligation for an RP to include its RPRC in a presentation request, even if it has one. It's useful to document this in the ARF.</em></td>

<td>No way for the RP to declare its intended use in the request</td>

The Commission SHALL reference or create an extension of ISO/IEC 18013-5 and OpenID4VP that enables this. 2) In case the RP is an intermediary, the URL SHALL be a URL pointing to the privacy policy of the end-RP, not the intermediary. See also issue #5 below. 3) The Wallet Unit SHALL enable the User to indicate that they want to be informed about the purpose of the RP. If the User indicates this, the Wallet Unit SHALL invoke a browser and take them to the URL.</td>

<td>According to Topic X, the RPRC of a PID Provider or Attestation Provider contains its entitlements. However, according to the ARF section 6.3.2.3., this information is contained in the access certificate, because according to section 6.3.2.1, a PID Provider or Attestation Provider does not receive a RPRC when it registers. According to section 6.3.2.3, the access certificate of a PID Provider or Attestation Provider may optionally also contain the Provider's entitlement to issue attestations of a specific type, for instance an mDL or diploma. In the IA on RP registration, these are called sub-entitlements.</td>
<td>6.3.2.1, 6.3.2.3, 6.6.2.1, 6.6.2.2, New/changed HLRs needed in Topic 10/23, Also updates to Topic X needed</td>
<td>Contradictions need to be removed. Clarity needs to be given about where the Wallet Unit can find entitlements in case there is no RPRC.</td>
<td>1) Unlike currently described in the ARF, a PID Provider or Attestation Provider optionally receives a RPRC during registration. This RPRC contains its basic entitlements as well as its sub-entitlements. So the sub-entitlements are not optional, like currently in the ARF. 2) The (sub-)entitlements of a PID Provider or Attestation Provider will not be included in the access cert, unlike currently described in the ARF. (Just like the registered attributes are not included in the access cert of an RP.) 3) The access cert of a PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL also contain the URL of an end point of the Registrar that the Wallet Unit can use to obtain information about the Provider. 4) If a Wallet Unit contacts an Attestation Provider to request issuance of an attestation, it receives an access certificate and optionally a RPRC from the Provider. If there is no RPRC, the Wallet Unit SHALL contact the Registrar and requests the entitlements of the Attestation Provider. 5) Like when a RPRC is present, the Wallet Unit SHALL notify the User in case the Attestation Provider has not been registered for the attestation type. In addition, the Wallet Unit SHALL also notify the User in case the Wallet Unit was not able to contact the Registrar. Otherwise (i.e., if everything is OK), a User notification is optional. <em>Notes: (i) In step 4 contacting the Register is mandatory and should not be left to the User to decide (like in #issue 1 above). This is because the risk to privacy is less compared to the analogous risk in issue #1.  (ii) Additionally, we need to check if the ARF already describes that a Relying Party can also check the subentitlement of an Attestation Provider.</em></td>

<td>No way for the Wallet Unit to know that the intermediary is requesting attributes on behalf of an end-RP. No way for the Wallet Unit to receive the name of the end-RP.</td>
<td>The process is basically the same as for issue #1 above: 1) The URL of the end point of the Registrar mentioned in step 1) of issue #1 enables the Wallet Unit to obtain information about the intermediary as well as its end-Relying Parties. Note that according to the IA on RP registration, an intermediary and its end-RPs are always registered by the same Registrar. 2) If the intermediary does not include an RPRC in the presentation request, it SHALL include the user-friendly name and the unique identifier of the end-RP in a different field of the presentation request. The Commission SHALL reference or create an extension of ISO/IEC 18013-5 and OpenID4VP that enables this. The Wallet Unit SHALL show the user-friendly name of the end-RP to the User when asking for User approval. 3) If the User has indicated that they want to do the additional verifications meant in step 2) of issue #1, a. the Wallet Unit SHALL retrieve the RPRC from the presentation request, if present, and proceed as already described in the ARF 1.9.0.  b. If the RPRC is not present, the Wallet Unit SHALL retrieve the unique identifier of the end-PR from the presentation request and use it to request the Registrar at the URL in point 1) to confirm (i) that this RP indeed uses the services of this intermediary. (ii) that this end-RP has been properly registered for the attributes it is requesting. c. The Wallet Unit SHALL notify the User about the outcome of these verifications in case one or both of them are unsuccessful. The Wallet Unit SHALL also notify the User in case the Wallet Unit was not able to retrieve the RPRC information. Otherwise (i.e., if everything is OK), a User notification is optional.</td>

<td>HLR DASH_03 says: For a presentation transaction executed through the Wallet Unit, the log SHALL contain the name, contact details, and unique identifier of the corresponding Relying Party, and the Member State in which that Relying Party is established. DASH_05 says For an issuance or re-issuance transaction executed through the Wallet Unit, the log SHALL contain the name, contact details, and unique identifier of the corresponding PID Provider or Attestation Provider. These HRLs do not say where the Wallet Unit gets this information, and neither does the main document.  But the assumption was from the RPRC. Moreover, in Topic M it was decided that the RPRC also contains the contact details of the relevant DPA.</td>
<td>Topic 19, (After 1.10:) Topic 48, Topic 50</td>
<td>The name and unique ID are in the RP access certificate, but the contact details are not (to my understanding). So we need to define where the Wallet Unit gets this information if there is no RPRC.</td>
<td>DASH_03 and DASH_05 must be adapted to say that name and unique ID come from the access certificate, and that logging of the contact details is only required if there is a RPRC containing this info. Moreover, the Wallet Unit SHALL log the URL of the end point of the Registrar (from the access cert, see also point 1 in issue #1). During integration of Topic L (data deletion) and M (report to DPA) into the ARF, we need to specify how the Wallet Unit obtains the contact details of the RP or the DPA in case these are not in the log (because there was no RPRC). The Wallet Unit can contact the Registrar to do so.</td>

<td>The ARF does not contain the concept of a Trusted List of Relying Party Registrars. Yet, Topic 44 says that such Registrars sign RP registration certificates, and that Wallet Units must verify the authenticity of these certificates. A Wallet Unit can only do so if it has the trust anchors of all Registrars, and that implies we need a Trusted List for them.</td>
<td>Main document chapter 6 (including in Figure 11), Annex 2 Topic 44.</td>
<td>Add the Trusted List of Relying Party Registrars both in the ARF main document and in Topic 44.</td>

<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>The ARF main document does not distinguish a Registrar for Wallet Providers, PID Providers and Attestation Providers. Instead, it says that these entities are registered by a Trusted List Provider. This is also shown in Figure 11. This is not consistent with the language used in the IA on RP registration.</td>
<td>Main document chapter 6 (including in Figure 11), Topic 44</td>
<td>We need to introduce a separate Access Certificate Provider and Registration Certificate Provider, as these roles are introduced in the IA on Art 5b, in addition to the role of Registrar.</td>
</tr>

<td>9</td>
<td>The ARF is not clear on the number of RPRCs per request and the number of purposes per RPRC. This needs to be explained.</td>
<td>6.6.3.3, Topic 44</td>
<td>Each request by an RP shall have one purpose and shall therefore have only one RPRC. The RP may request attributes from multiple attestations, but those should all be covered by the same RPRC. (i) If the RP wants to request data for multiple purposes from the same Wallet Unit, they shall send multiple requests. (ii) It's the RP's responsibility to ensure that they get an RPRC for each of their purposes. (iii) A purpose is indicated by means of a URL to the privacy policy of the Relying Party regarding the intended use. See also issue #2 above.</td>

<td>The ARF must no longer use "suspension" and "withdrawal" of the RP, but "suspension" and "cancellation" of the registration of an RP when talking about registration</td>
