<p>Version 0.9, created 14 May 2025</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions/480">GitHub discussion</a></p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper topic description</h3>
<p>The present discussion paper discusses how a wallet user can use her wallet unit to request the 
erasure of personal data at a wallet-relying party and for reporting a relying party to the competent 
data protection supervisory authority. </p>
<p>The present paper builds upon and recalls (see <a href="#3-existing-high-level-requirements">clause 3</a>) 
the existing high level requirements from <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2348-topic-48---blueprint-for-requesting-data-deletion-to-relying-parties"><strong>Topic 48</strong> (Blueprint for requesting data deletion to Relying Parties)</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2350-topic-50---blueprint-to-report-unlawful-or-suspicious-request-of-data"><strong>Topic 50</strong> (Blueprint to report unlawful or suspicious request of data)</a>, before it 
discusses these topics in <a href="#4-erasure-of-personal-data-at-a-wallet-relying-party">clause 4</a> and <a href="#5-reporting-a-wallet-relying-party-to-the-competent-data-protection-supervisory-authority">clause 5</a>. </p>
<p>The result of the discussions documented in the present paper is the updated set of high level requirements as laid down in <a href="#6-updated-set-of-high-level-requriements-">clause 6</a>.</p>
<h3 id="12-related-risks-in-the-risk-register">1.2 Related risks in the Risk Register</h3>
<p>Risks considered in <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/a-privacy-risks-and-mitigations.md">Topic_A</a> are also applicable here and additional risks
may be added in this discussion paper, if this turns out to be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="13-key-words">1.3 Key words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in <a href="http://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.</p>
<p>In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is
mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas
other words, such as 'will' and 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of
fact.</p>
<h3 id="14-relevant-definitions-and-requirements-from-eu-2016679">1.4 Relevant definitions and requirements from (EU) 2016/679</h3>
<p>Article 2 (4) of <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj">(EU) No 910/2014</a> stipulates that this regulation is without prejudice to the 
''General Data Protection Regulation'' (GDPR) <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> and hence it seems to be appropriate to recall 
the most relevant stipulations from GDPR here.  In particular, the lodging of a complaint to 
Data Protection Authorities on the grounds of Article 57 (1) (f) of regulation (EU) 2016/679
is a different and independent recourse mechanism from the reporting to a Data Protection Authority 
provided for in Article 5a (4) (d) (iii) of the regulation (EU) No. 910/2014. This does not 
prevent a Data Protection Authorities to use in its GDPR-based tasks information gathering 
from eIDAS-based reports received.</p>
<h4 id="141-definitions-from-eu-2016679">1.4.1 Definitions from (EU) 2016/679</h4>
<p>Article 4 of <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> in particular contains the
following definitions: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) ‘<strong>personal data</strong>’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</p>
<p>(2) ‘<strong>processing</strong>’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;</p>
<p>(5) ‘<strong>pseudonymisation</strong>’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;</p>
<p>(6) ‘<strong>filing system</strong>’ means any structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis;</p>
<p>(7) ‘<strong>controller</strong>’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</p>
<p>(8) ‘<strong>processor</strong>’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;</p>
<p>(9) ‘<strong>recipient</strong>’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.

<h2 id="2-overview">2. Overview</h2>
<p>According to Article 5a (5) (a) of Regulation <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj">(EU) No 910/2014</a>
a wallet solution shall support common protocols and interfaces for</p>
<ul>
<li>(ix) requesting a relying party to <strong>erase the personal data</strong> stored at a wallet-relying party pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation
  <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> and</li>
<li>(x) <strong>reporting a relying party to the competent national data protection authority</strong> where 
an allegedly unlawful or suspicious request for data is received.</li>
</ul>
<p>The present document discusses topics related to these protocols and interfaces, as outlined in the following figure. </p>
<p><img alt="Overview" src="../img/Privacy-Architecture.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The discussion with the experts from the EU Member States soon revealed, that 
one may safely assume that there are already suitable processes in place for the process of data erasure
requests addressed within the present document. For reports to Data Protection Authorities, there may 
exist partially similar processes linked to handling GDPR-related complaints in spite of their different legal 
grounds (both processes involve a user sending information to a Data Protection Authority about a third party).</p>
<p>Therefore, the overall strategy of the present document is to utilise the existing interfaces 
and processes of the relying parties and supervisory authorities as much as possible and abstain from
the creation of additional interfaces to wallet-relying parties and supervisory authorities.    </p>

<h2 id="4-erasure-of-personal-data-at-a-wallet-relying-party">4. Erasure of personal data at a wallet-relying party</h2>
<h4 id="41-discussions-related-to-data_dlt_01-and-data_dlt_02">4.1 Discussions related to DATA_DLT_01 and DATA_DLT_02</h4>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspects related to DATA_DLT_01 and DATA_DLT_02 have been discussed:</p>
<p>1) The wording "in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679" in DATA_DLT_01 leaves
   room for interpretation what exactly is meant here. Therefore the
   text should better be changed to "in accordance with <strong>Article 17 of</strong> Regulation (EU) 2016/679".</p>
<p>The resulting requirement <strong>DATA_DLT_01</strong> is hence specified as follows, whereas the changes are marked as <strong>bold</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Wallet Provider SHALL ensure that its Wallet Units support the technical specifications mentioned in 
DATA_DLT_02, allowing a User to request from a Relying Party the erasure of their attributes that were 
presented by that Wallet Unit to that Relying Party, in accordance with <strong>Article 17 of</strong> Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2) During the discussions it was mentioned that one may assume that relying parties, which act as processors or controllers
   <strong>already have procedures, protocols and interfaces in place to handle data deletion requests</strong> in accordance
   with regulation (EU) 2016/679. There was a consensus among the participants in the discussion, that the wallet unit should simply
   re-use the already existing interfaces offered by the wallet-relying parties. As there are no standardised protocols
   and interfaces for this purpose (yet), this implies that the wallet unit can offer only to <strong>open an external mail client with a suitable 
   template text</strong> or offer only to <strong>open a specific URL with an external browser</strong> to ask for the deletion of data 
   in a web form provided by the wallet-relying party. It was suggested, that the registration certificate should contain 
   the necessary contact information of the wallet-relying party, including an email address or the location of a web form 
   for privacy-related enquiries.</p>
<p>3) It was also discussed that the details of the handling of the data deletion request is
   within the responsibility of the wallet-relying party in its role as controller, or processor
   acting on behalf of a controller. According to Article 12 (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the controller may 
   request additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject. In any case Article 24 of 
   (EU) 2016/679 clarifies that the controller is responsible for the implementation of suitable technical and 
   organisational measures for the protection of personal data in line with Article 32 of (EU) 2016/679, which 
   obviously includes the requirement to <strong>authenticate the user</strong>, which submits a data deletion request, 
   <strong>or the request itself</strong> using an appropriate electronic signature. The <strong>technical details</strong> for this 
   authentication procedure are within the <strong>responsibility of the wallet-relying party</strong>, 
   acting as controller or processor, and hence there can only be a <strong>recommendation</strong> for the wallet-relying party 
   to utilise the strong authentication or signature facilities offered by the wallet solutions for this purpose.</p>
<p>This additional recommendation <strong>DATA_DLT_07</strong> is specified as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the Wallet-Relying Party is responsible for choosing appropriate authentication mechanisms before
executing a data deletion request, it is RECOMMENDED to use the authentication and signature 
facilities offered by the Wallet Solutions for this purpose.    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that the Commission and the EU Member States can only encourage and facilitate the development of 
   appropriate <strong>codes of conducts</strong> for wallet-relying parties according to Article 5f of (EU) No. 910/2014, 
   which may also address privacy-related aspects, such as the exercise of rights of data subjects according 
   to Article 40 Nr. 2 (f) of (EU) 2016/679 for example. These code of conducts could
   include the <strong>recommendation</strong> to utilise the strong and trustworthy <strong>authentication, identification and 
   qualified electronic signature</strong> capabilities of the wallet solutions for implementing the necessary 
   authentication procedure. In a similar manner, such aspects may also be addressed in certification criteria 
   according to Article 42 of (EU) 2016/679.</p>
<h4 id="42-discussions-related-to-data_dlt_03">4.2 Discussions related to DATA_DLT_03</h4>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspect related to DATA_DLT_03 was discussed:</p>
<p>The possibility to send a data deletion request to more than one relying party in a single step does not seem to be appropriate
for the specific case, as requesting the data deletion is a rather sensitive process. Therefore it was agreed that the words
"<strong>or multiple Relying Parties</strong>" in DATA_DLT_03 should better be <strong>deleted</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="43-discussions-related-to-data_dlt_04">4.3 Discussions related to DATA_DLT_04</h4>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspect related to DATA_DLT_04 was discussed:</p>
<p>It was suggested to <strong>delete this requirement</strong>, as the detailed requirements of the common dashboard are handled in <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2319-topic-19---user-navigation-requirements-dashboard-logs-for-transparency">Topic 19</a>.</p>
<h4 id="44-discussions-related-to-data_dlt_05">4.4 Discussions related to DATA_DLT_05</h4>
<p>The discussions related to DATA_DLT_05 <strong>did not reveal any need for changes</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="45-discussions-related-to-data_dlt_06">4.5 Discussions related to DATA_DLT_06</h4>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspects related to DATA_DLT_06 were discussed:</p>
<p>1) The point was raised that the wallet unit is only able to initiate the process for a data
   deletion request and hence it is unclear what exactly the log according to Article 5a (4) (d) of
   the regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should contain. As the regulation speaks about a
   "log of all transactions", which contains a "list of relying parties with which the user
   has established a connection and, where applicable, all data exchanged", it seems to be appropriate
   to also <strong>log the initiation of a data deletion request</strong>, even if it is not clear, whether the
   partly prepared email was submitted in the end.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was agreed to change the text of <strong>DATA_DLT_06</strong> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The log SHALL <strong>also document the initiation of a data deletion request and</strong> include as a minimum: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Date <strong>and time</strong> of attribute deletion request, </li>
<li>Relying Party to which the request was made, </li>
<li>Attributes requested to be removed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="5-reporting-a-wallet-relying-party-to-the-competent-data-protection-supervisory-authority">5. Reporting a wallet-relying party to the competent data protection supervisory authority</h2>
<h3 id="51-discussions-related-to-rpt_dpa_01">5.1 Discussions related to RPT_DPA_01</h3>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspects related to <strong>RPT_DPA_01</strong> have been discussed:</p>
<p>1) According to Article 4 (22) of the regulation (EU) 2016/679, the wallet user may, in its role of being the data subject,
   report suspicious behaviour to, or even lodge a complaint according to Article 77 of (EU) 2016/679 with, different supervisory authorities, including</p>
<p>a) the supervisory authority responsible for the region in which the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority;</p>
<p>b) data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are substantially affected or likely to be substantially affected by the processing;</p>
<p>c) or a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority;</p>
<p>2) As the regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 in its Article 5a (4) (d) (iii) and Article 5a (5) (a) (x) mentions the
   "reporting a relying party to the competent national data protection authority", it is clear that
   the wallet unit should in particular allow to get in contact with the competent national supervisory authority,
   which supervises the wallet-relying party. If the contact details of the supervisory authority for the wallet-relying
   party information is not available, the wallet unit should offer to get in contact with the supervisory authority
   of the wallet provider and it may even offer a link to the members of the European Data Protection Board at
   https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en.</p>
<p>Against the background of the discussion and comments received, it was agreed upon updating <strong>RPT_DPA_01</strong> to the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When prompted by the User, a Wallet Unit SHALL provide the contact details of the DPA, which supervises
the Relying Party, if available, and SHALL make it easy for the User to send a report of allegedly unlawful or 
suspicious Relying Party presentation requests to this DPA. If these are not available, the Wallet Unit SHALL 
provide the contact details of the DPA of the region in which the Wallet Provider is residing. In addition, the Wallet Unit MAY
also provide contact details of other DPAs taken from the "European Data Protection Board" website (https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en),
and allow the User to choose a DPA to continue the reporting process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="52-discussions-related-to-rpt_dpa_02">5.2 Discussions related to RPT_DPA_02</h3>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspects related to RPT_DPA_02 have been discussed:</p>
<p>It was discussed that there is difference between reporting suspicious
behaviour of a wallet-relying party as required by Article 5a of (EU) No. 910/2014
and lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority according to Article 77 of (EU) 2016/679.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was agreed to change the text of <strong>RPT_DPA_02</strong> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The User interface enabling a User to start the process of <strong>reporting a Wallet-relying Party to
a DPA</strong> SHALL be accessible via the log provided by the Wallet Unit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="53-discussions-related-to-rpt_dpa_03">5.3 Discussions related to RPT_DPA_03</h3>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspect related to <strong>RPT_DPA_03</strong> was discussed:</p>
<p>It was discussed, whether mentioning the national procedural law is suitable here,
as fulfilling the requirements of the regulation (EU) 2016/679 should be
sufficient. The wallet providers should better not be obliged to take into account
requirements from national procedural law and hence it was decided to delete this requirement.</p>
<h3 id="54-discussions-related-to-rpt_dpa_04">5.4 Discussions related to RPT_DPA_04</h3>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspects related to <strong>RPT_DPA_04</strong> were discussed:</p>
<p>It was discussed, whether the text "and the User's allegation" is appropriate here, as
this does not seem to be mentioned in the regulation (EU) No. 910/2014.</p>
<p>However, Article 7 of the implementing act (EU) 2024/2982 mentions the possibility to "substantiate the reports, including by attaching relevant information
to identify the wallet-relying parties, and the wallet users’ claims in machine-readable format".</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was discussed that Article 5a (4) (d) (i) of the regulation
(EU) No. 910/2014 requires that the log allows to "view an up-to-date list of relying parties
with which the user has established a connection <strong>and, where applicable, all data exchanged</strong>".
The related storage requirements seem to be rather modest, as the digital signatures are usually
rather small. On the other hand, it was also argued, that it is questionable that submitting
the signatures with the initial report migth not be necessary, as this kind of information could
be provided after an explicit request of the DPA in a subsequent step. In this case the wallet unit
could also be used to sign an export from the log to provide non-repudiation.</p>
<p>Against this background it was decided to revise the text of <strong>RPT_DPA_04</strong> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wallet providers SHALL ensure that wallet units allow wallet users to substantiate the reports,
including by attaching relevant information to identify the wallet-relying parties, and the wallet users’
claims in machine-readable format.</p>
<p>Note: The log kept by the Wallet Unit will be standardized and is machine-readable
in order to enable data portability. An excerpt from this log therefore can be used to substantiate the report.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="55-discussions-related-to-rpt_dpa_05">5.5 Discussions related to RPT_DPA_05</h3>
<p>During the discussions with the delegated experts from the EU Member States the following
aspects related to <strong>RPT_DPA_05</strong> were discussed:</p>
<p>Based on the discussion it was agreed, that there shall be an additional HLR in Topic 19, which
specifies the technical details and the precise data format of the log and the possibilities for
the export of the data for the purpose of reporting.</p>
<p>The question was raised, whether the data from the log could be inserted in an attachment of an email
and that the other option would be that the wallet unit could itself become an email client. In any case
it would be possible to export this data into a file and attach this file to an email.
In order to make it easy for the user to submit such a report, the contact information of the DPA in charge
should be part of the log, if possible.</p>
<p>The issue was raised that the wallet unit can not be entirely sure, that the report was indeed sent
to the DPA and hence it is not entirely clear, whether it makes sense to log it.</p>
<p>Against this background it was decided to slightly revise the text of <strong>RPT_DPA_05</strong> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Wallet Unit SHALL log the <strong>initiation of a</strong> report sent to the DPA in a log file so that it can be presented to the User in the dashboard (as specified in Topic 19).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="56-additional-high-level-requirement-rpt_dpa_06">5.6 Additional high level requirement RPT_DPA_06</h3>
<p>During the discussion of <a href="#51-discussions-related-to-rpt_dpa_01">RPT_DPA_01</a> it was agreed to add
the following high level requirement as <strong>RPT_DPA_06</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Wallet Unit SHALL take the contact details of the DPA, which supervises the Relying Party,
either (in this order) from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) included in  the RPRC in the log entry,</p>
<p>b) included in the RPAC in the log entry,</p>
<p>c) looked up by the Wallet Unit from the RP Registry, based on the Subject of the RPAC in the log entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contact information includes  at least one of email address, phone number, or a URL of a webform.</p>
