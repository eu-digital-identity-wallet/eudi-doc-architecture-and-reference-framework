<h1 id="k-combined-presentation-of-attestations">K - Combined presentation of Attestations</h1>
<p>Version 1.0, updated 26 May 2025</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions/519">Link to GitHub discussion</a></p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper topic description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for European Digital Identity Cooperation Group regarding
Topic K - Combined presentation of Attestations</p>
<p>The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p>Requirements for implementing “combined presentation” need to be clearly defined. 
Combined presentation involves a transaction in which a Relying Party requests 
multiple attributes associated with the same User from various attestations 
(PID and/or (Q)EAAs) in a single request and receives those attributes consolidated 
in a single response. The goal for the Relying Party is to verify that all received 
attributes belong to the same User.</p>
<h2 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key words</h2>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.</p>
<p>In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is
mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas
other words, such as 'will' and 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of
fact.</p>
<h2 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document structure</h2>
<p>This document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 presents legal requirements and High Level Requirements (HLRs) defined
in the Annex 2 of the ARF for the combined presentation of Attestations.</li>
<li>Chapter 3 details the topic and introduces discussion items</li>
<li>Chapter 4 lists the additions and changes that will be made to the ARF
as a result of discussing this topic with Member States.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-and-existing-high-level-requirements">2. Legal requirements and existing High Level Requirements</h2>
<p>According to the [European Digital Identity Regulation], article 5a (4):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>European Digital Identity Wallets shall enable the user, in a manner that is user-friendly, 
transparent, and traceable by the user, to:
(a) securely request, obtain, select, <strong>combine</strong>, store, delete, share and present, under the sole 
control of the user, person identification data and, where applicable, in combination with electronic 
attestations of attributes, to authenticate to relying parties online and, where appropriate, 
in offline mode, in order to access public and private services, while ensuring that selective disclosure 
of data is possible; [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Annex 2 of ARF includes the following High Level Requirements (HLRs) for
to the combined presentation of Attestations:</p>

<h2 id="3-discussion">3. Discussion</h2>
<p>The concept of <em>combined presentation</em> refers to a process where a Relying Party 
requests multiple attributes concerning a single User, drawn from separate attestations 
(e.g., PID and/or (Q)EAAs), and receives a consolidated, verified response. The key 
functional goal is to enable the Relying Party to confirm that all presented attributes 
genuinely pertain to the same User without 
compromising trust, privacy, or data integrity.</p>
<h3 id="31-use-cases">3.1 Use Cases</h3>
<h3 id="real-world-use-cases-for-combined-presentation">Real-World Use Cases for Combined Presentation</h3>
<p>Scenarios where a User is asked to present different attributes from various 
physical documents are common in the real world—and are also relevant in the digital domain. 
These scenarios can be addressed more efficiently through combined presentation 
allowing a Relying Party to receive a consolidated set of attributes 
from different attestations.</p>
<h4 id="university-admissions"><strong>University Admissions</strong></h4>
<p>A university evaluating prospective students may request a digital presentation containing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal identification</strong> (from a PID),</li>
<li><strong>Academic credentials</strong> (from diploma or qualification attestations),</li>
<li><strong>Work or research experience</strong> (from employment attestations or other EAAs).</li>
</ul>
<p>These attributes typically originate from different issuers and must be validated as 
belonging to the same applicant. A combined presentation enables the university to 
efficiently pre-screen candidates based on custom admission criteria, while avoiding 
the processing of unnecessary data.</p>
<h4 id="professional-licensing"><strong>Professional Licensing</strong></h4>
<p>A regulatory body responsible for licensing professionals (e.g., doctors, lawyers, engineers) may require a presentation that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proof of identity</strong> (PID),</li>
<li><strong>Professional degrees and certifications</strong> (from educational authorities),</li>
<li><strong>Proof of prior licensure or work experience</strong> (from previous employers or licensing bodies).</li>
</ul>
<p>By accepting a combined presentation, the authority can streamline application reviews 
while ensuring all data belongs to the same applicant, supported by secure bindings 
across attestations.</p>
<h4 id="rental-or-loan-applications"><strong>Rental or Loan Applications</strong></h4>
<p>When applying for a loan or renting a property, a service provider may request attributes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity verification</strong> (from PID),</li>
<li><strong>Proof of income or employment</strong> (from employer attestations),</li>
<li><strong>Creditworthiness or financial history</strong> (from financial institutions or credit bureaus).</li>
</ul>
<p>These data points are usually dispersed across documents and issuers. Combined presentation 
allows the User to share only the required attributes in a secure, verifiable, 
and privacy-preserving way—simplifying onboarding while reducing the risk of fraud 
or misrepresentation.</p>
<h3 id="32-identity-matching">3.2 Identity Matching</h3>
<p>A preliminary requirement for the combined presentation of attestations is 
<strong>identity matching</strong>. The Relying Party shall be able to verify that all attributes 
included in the presentation originate from attestations that refer to the same 
User. Without such a mechanism, there is a risk of malicious combinations; for example, 
using a valid facial image from one User together with another person's <code>"age over 18"</code> 
attribute could enable fraud or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Solutions for enabling Relying Parties to verify that all attributes 
included in a presentation originate from attestations that refer to the same 
User include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Relying Party-Specific Identifiers</strong>: Unique identifiers assigned by the Relying 
Party—such as customer or contract numbers—that can be used to associate multiple attestations with the same User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attribute-Based Binding</strong>: Attestations may include a shared unique identifier 
(e.g., a PID number), which can serve as a binding reference across different attestations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Issuer-Attested Binding</strong>: An Issuer may issue a dedicated attestation to the Wallet 
Unit explicitly confirming that two or more attestations relate to the same entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cryptographic Binding</strong>: The Wallet Unit generates a Proof of Association (PoA) 
demonstrating that the private keys associated with the involved 
attestations are managed by the same WSCD.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We discuss in more detail the latter mechanism in Section 3.4.</p>
<h3 id="33-security-consideration">3.3 Security consideration</h3>
<h4 id="policies-for-including-attributes">Policies for Including Attributes</h4>
<p>Each attestation may have its own <strong>Embedded Disclosure Policy</strong>. In parallel,
the <strong>Relying Party Registration Certificate</strong> may grant different access rights 
to different types of attestations. 
When a Relying Party requests a combined presentation containing attributes from 
multiple attestations, the <strong>strictest applicable policy</strong> must prevail. </p>
<h4 id="validity-of-combined-presentation">Validity of Combined Presentation</h4>
<p>The <strong>validity period</strong> of a combined presentation shall be determined by the 
<strong>minimum validity</strong> of the individual attestations whose attributes are included. </p>
<h4 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h4>
<p>Although individual attributes may not be personally identifying or trackable on 
their own, their <strong>combination across attestations</strong> may create a <strong>unique tracking vector</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="34-proofs-of-association-poa">3.4 Proofs of Association (PoA)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Proof of Association (PoA)</strong> is an envisioned cryptographic mechanism that allows 
a Wallet Unit to prove that the private keys corresponding to two (or more) public keys 
are managed by the same WSCD.</p>
<p>PoA can be used during attestation issuance, e.g., to prove that the public key 
included in a PID and the public key to be embedded in a newly requested attestation 
are both managed by the same WSCD, as well as, during presentation, e.g., <br />
to prove that the public keys associated with two (or more) device-bound 
attestations are managed by the same WSCD.</p>
<p>A PoA offers the following advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified signature process</strong>:<br />
  Proving possession of one of the private keys can be interpreted as proof of possession 
  for all associated keys, reducing the need for multiple presentation signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy-preserving correlation</strong>:<br />
  Attestations can be linked without disclosing identifying attributes that may 
  lead to tracking. For example, including a PID number across multiple attestations 
  could enable linking; PoA avoids this by offering cryptographic correlation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A PoA <strong>does not, by itself, guarantee</strong> that two attestations belong to the same User. 
For such assurance, a Provider must ensure that the device to which an attestation 
is bound is indeed controlled by the User to whom the attestation refers.</p>

<h3 id="41-high-level-requirements-to-be-added-to-annex-2">4.1 High-Level Requirements to be added to Annex 2</h3>
<h3 id="requirement-1">REQUIREMENT 1</h3>
<p>A Proof of Association scheme SHALL rely solely on algorithms standardised by a standardisation 
organisation recognised by the Commission or in a standard recognised by the Commission.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-2">REQUIREMENT 2</h3>
<p>A Proof of Association scheme SHALL enable a proof that two or more public keys, 
each embedded in a separate device-bound attestation, are managed by the same WSCD.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-3">REQUIREMENT 3</h3>
<p>A Proof of Association scheme MAY be implemented using a Zero-Knowledge Proof mechanism 
that satisfies the requirements specified in Topic G.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-4">REQUIREMENT 4</h3>
<p>A Proof of Association scheme SHALL be usable in attestation issuance flow as well as in
both remote and proximity presentation flows.</p>
<h3 id="42-high-level-requirements-to-be-changed">4.2 High-Level Requirements to be changed</h3>
<p>Requirements (ACP_01 - ACP_09) will be removed. Requirements
ACP_01 and ACP_02 are already covered by the requirements set in Topic 1. The removal of 
requirements ACP_03- ACP_09 is justified by the fact that they rely on cryptographic 
mechanisms that are currently unavailable or not sufficiently mature for practical deployment. 
As these requirements cannot be fulfilled in a secure and reliable manner with today’s technology, 
their inclusion would impose unrealistic expectations on implementers. Instead, alternative 
mechanisms—such as those described in <strong>Section 3.2</strong>—offer practical and implementable approaches 
that can achieve the intended security goals using currently available infrastructure. 
These alternatives are currently the only viable approach for implementing secure
combined presentation of attestations. Additionally, we introduce a new High-Level
Requirement describing the desirable properties of such a mechanism. </p>
