# ANNEX 2.03 - High-Level Requirements by category<!-- omit from toc -->

## A.2 High-level requirements by category

### A.2.1 Introduction

This annex to the ARF main document includes high-level requirements (HLRs)
related to the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. The requirements define the responsible
actor that should implement each requirement. There are no requirements imposed
on the Users. All requirements in this Annex only apply in the context of the
EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

This Annex uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this annex.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e., a requirement that is not mandated by this document, but, for
instance, by an external standard or specification. The word 'can' indicates a
capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', and 'is' or 'are', are intended
as statements of fact.

## Part 1: Actor-Specific Requirements

### 1. Wallet Providers

*These requirements are the responsibility of the entities building and managing*
*the EUDI Wallet solutions. They cover the core functionalities, security, user*
*interface elements, and lifecycle management of the wallet.*

{% for req in requirements['Wallet Providers'] %}
|{{ req.Harmonized_ID }} | {{ req.Index }} | {{ req.Requirement_specification }}| {{ req.Notes }} |
{% endfor %}

### 2. Member States & Registrars

*These requirements are for the public bodies that establish the legal and trust*
*infrastructure. They focus on establishing registries, notifying the*
*Commission, and defining national policies.*

### 3. Attestation & PID Providers

*These requirements are for the organizations that issue digital credentials to*
*the wallet. This includes requirements for identity verification, issuance*
*protocols, data formats, and revocation policies.*

### 4. Relying Parties

*These requirements are for the services and entities that accept and use the*
*EUDI Wallet. They cover how they must register, authenticate themselves to the*
*wallet, request user attributes, and handle user data.*

| **Identifier** | **Legacy Identifier** | **Description** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
{% for req in requirements['Relying Parties'] %}

{% endfor %}

## Part 2: Ecosystem-Wide Rules

### 5. Protocols & Interoperability

*These requirements define the common communication standards and protocols that*
*ensure the entire system works together seamlessly across borders. This covers*
*how different components talk to each other.*

| **Identifier** | **Legacy Identifier** | **Description** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
{% for req in requirements['Protocols & Interoperability'] %}
|{{ req.Harmonized_ID }} | {{ req.Index }} | {{ req.Requirement_specification }}| {{ req.Notes }} |
{% endfor %}

---

### 6. Data Models & Attestation Rules

*These requirements define the structure and meaning of the data being*
*exchanged. This includes HLRs for PIDs, Attestation Rulebooks, and Catalogues,*
*ensuring that the information exchanged is consistent and understandable across*
*the entire ecosystem.*

| **Identifier** | **Legacy Identifier** | **Description** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
{% for req in requirements['Data Models & Attestation Rules'] %}
|{{ req.Harmonized_ID }} | {{ req.Index }} | {{ req.Requirement_specification }}| {{ req.Notes }} |
{% endfor %}

## A.2.2 Backward Reference: Original Topics

This section provides the titles and descriptions of the original topics from
which the High-Level Requirements were sourced and restructured.

- **Topic 1 - Accessing Online Services with a Wallet Unit**: One of the main
use cases of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem is to enable Users to access online
services and to enable Relying Parties offering such services to, where needed,
identify and authenticate Users with a high level of assurance.
- **Topic 2 - Mobile Driving Licence within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem**: A User
can obtain their mobile Driving Licence (mDL) from an mDL Provider and store it
in a Wallet Unit. The User can then present the mDL to a Relying Party upon
request to prove their driving rights conveniently, securely, and in compliance
with the Driving Licences Directive.
- **Topic 3 - PID Rulebook**: The Person Identification Data (PID) Rulebook
contains requirements specific to the PID within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.
- **Topic 4 - mDL Rulebook**: The mobile driving licence (mDL) Rulebook contains
requirements specific to the mDL use case within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.
- **Topic 6 - Relying Party authentication and User approval**: Relying Party
authentication is a process whereby a Relying Party proves its identity to a
Wallet Unit, in the context of a transaction in which the Relying Party requests
the Wallet Unit to release some attributes.
- **Topic 7 - Attestation revocation and revocation checking**: This Topic
contains the high-level requirements (HLRs) relating to the (possible)
revocation of PIDs, QEAAs, PuB-EAAs, non-qualified EAAs, and WUAs by their
providers.
- **Topic 9 - Wallet Unit Attestation**: When a User's Wallet Unit interacts
with other actors in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, in particular PID Providers,
Attestation Providers, or Relying Parties, these actors may want to verify if
the Wallet Unit is authentic and has not been revoked.
- **Topic 10 - Issuing a PID or attestation to a Wallet Unit**: PID Providers
and Attestation Providers issue PIDs and attestations to Wallet Units. This
Topic lists the high-level technical requirements related to PID and attestation
issuance.
- **Topic 11 - Pseudonyms**: Wallet Units will support generating pseudonyms for
Users in compliance with the W3C WebAuthn API specification.
- **Topic 12 - Attestation Rulebooks**: This Topic describes the high-level
requirements for the Attestation Rulebooks that will specify the details of new
types of attestations.
- **Topic 16 - Signing documents with a Wallet Unit**: A Wallet Unit SHALL
enable its User to create qualified electronic signatures or seals.
- **Topic 17 - Identity matching**: Users would like to use their PID in their
Wallet Unit to access their existing online account(s), even if their PID
attribute values are not exactly the same as those in their account(s).
- **Topic 18 - Combined presentations of attributes**: The concept of combined
presentation refers to a process where a Relying Party requests multiple
attributes concerning a single User, drawn from separate attestations, and
receives a consolidated response.
- **Topic 19 - User navigation requirements (Dashboard logs for transparency)**:
The User is accessing a dashboard of the Wallet Unit, which provides a record of
all transactions executed through the Wallet Unit.
- **Topic 20 - Strong User authentication for electronic payments**: The
[European Digital Identity Regulation] requires Wallet Units to provide a
functionality of strong User authentication (SUA), among others in the context
of payments.
- **Topic 24 - User identification in proximity scenarios**: In this use case,
the User is using their Wallet Unit for identification purposes in proximity
scenarios.

This Topic defines high-level requirements regarding the catalogue for
Attestation Rulebooks.
- **Topic 27 - Registration of PID Providers, Providers of QEAAs, PuB-EAAs, and
non-qualified EAAs, and Relying Parties**: PID Providers, QEAA Providers,

with a Registrar in their Member State.
- **Topic 28 - Wallet Unit for legal persons**: This topic is focused on
identifying high-level requirements for a legal-person Wallet Unit.
- **Topic 29 - Representation paradigm**: It should be possible to issue a
dedicated representation attestation for a natural person to a representative,
in accordance with applicable national and European legislation.
