<h1 id="topic-h-transaction-logs-kept-by-the-wallet">Topic H - Transaction logs kept by the Wallet</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper Topic Description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group regarding Topic H: Transaction logs kept by the Wallet.</p>
<p>The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p><em>Define High-level requirements for implementing transaction logs generated by the wallet. Key trade-offs need consideration, including balancing the availability of logs that enable users to request data deletion from a Relying Party (RP) against the risk of that data potentially being exposed, particularly to the Wallet Provider. Similarly, there is a trade-off between ensuring data availability if a user changes devices and mitigating the associated risks of data exposure.</em></p>
<h3 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key Words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and options specified in this document.
In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document Structure</h3>
<p>The document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 presents the legal requirements for functionality related to transaction logs kept by the Wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 3 presents and discusses a list of identified issues, with suggested changes and/or new High-Level Requirements related to this topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 4 presents a log of the additions and changes that will be made to High Level Requirements in the ARF as a result of discussing this topic with the Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 5 refers to other topics related to transaction logs kept by the Wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 6 presents the additions and changes that will be made to the ARF main document as a result of discussions. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-for-transaction-logs">2 Legal Requirements for transaction logs</h2>
<h3 id="21-european-digital-identity-regulation-about-transaction-logs">2.1 [European Digital Identity Regulation] about transaction logs</h3>
<p>The [European Digital Identity Regulation] requires the Wallets to:
- keep the history of transaction (a "transaction log"), to allow the User to track all transactions executed through the Wallet Unit,
- the transaction log shall contain at least:
  - the time and date of the transaction,
  - the counterpart identification,
  - the personal data requested,
  - the data shared,
- enable and support execution of User's privacy and data protection rights, as set out by [GDPR].</p>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the Regulation, including the recitals and the articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (13)</strong> </p>
<p><em>European Digital Identity Wallets should have the function of a common dashboard embedded into the design, in order to ensure a higher degree of transparency, privacy and control of the users over their personal data. That function should provide an easy, user-friendly interface with an overview of all relying parties with whom the user shares data, including attributes, and the type of data shared with each relying party. It should allow users to track all transactions executed through the European Digital Identity Wallet with at least the following data: the time and date of the transaction, the counterpart identification, the personal data requested and the data shared. That information should be stored even if the transaction was not concluded. It should not be possible to repudiate the authenticity of the information contained in the transaction history. Such a function should be active by default. It should allow users easily to request the immediate erasure by a relying party of personal data pursuant Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and easily to report the relying party to the competent national data protection authority where an allegedly unlawful or suspicious request for personal data is received, directly via the European Digital Identity Wallet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (15)</strong></p>
<p><em>This Regulation sets out the harmonised conditions for the establishment of a framework for European Digital Identity Wallets to be provided by Member States. All Union citizens, and residents in the Union as defined by national law, should be empowered to securely request, select, combine, store, delete, share and present data related to their identity and request the erasure of their personal data in a user-friendly and convenient way, under the sole control of the user, while enabling selective disclosure of personal data. This Regulation reflects shared European values and respects fundamental rights, legal safeguards and liability, thus protecting democratic societies, Union citizens and residents in the Union. Technologies used to achieve those objectives should be developed aiming towards the highest level of security, privacy, user convenience, accessibility, wide usability and seamless interoperability.[...]</em> </p>
<p><strong>Recital (19)</strong></p>
<p><em>[...] Reliance on the legal identity should not hinder European Digital Identity Wallet users to access services under a pseudonym, where there is no legal requirement for legal identity for authentication.[...]</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (32)</strong></p>
<p><em>The use, free of charge, of European Digital Identity Wallets should not result in the processing of data beyond data that is necessary for the provision of European Digital Identity Wallet services. This Regulation should not allow the processing of personal data stored in or resulting from the use of the European Digital Identity Wallet by the provider of the European Digital Identity Wallet for purposes other than the provision of European Digital Identity Wallet services. To ensure privacy, European Digital Identity Wallet providers should ensure unobservability by not collecting data and not having insight into the transactions of the users of the European Digital Identity Wallet. Such unobservability means that the providers are not able to see the details of the transactions made by the user. However, in specific cases, on the basis of explicit prior consent by the user in each of those specific cases, and fully in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providers of European Digital Identity Wallets could be granted access to the information necessary for the provision of a particular service related to European Digital Identity Wallets.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5</strong></p>
<p><em>Pseudonyms in electronic transaction</em></p>
<p><em>Without prejudice to specific rules of Union or national law requiring users to identify themselves or to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use of pseudonyms that are chosen by the user shall not be prohibited.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5a(4)</strong></p>
<p><em>4.European Digital Identity Wallets shall enable the user, in a manner that is user-friendly, transparent, and traceable by the user, to:
[...]
(d) access a log of all transactions carried out through the European Digital Identity Wallet via a common dashboard enabling the user to:
  (i) view an up-to-date list of relying parties with which the user has established a connection and, where applicable, all data exchanged;
  (ii) easily request the erasure by a relying party of personal data pursuant to Article 17 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
  (iii) easily report a relying party to the competent national data protection authority, where an allegedly unlawful or suspicious request for data is     received;</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5a(16)</strong></p>
<p><em>The technical framework of the European Digital Identity Wallet shall:
(a) not allow providers of electronic attestations of attributes or any other party, after the issuance of the attestation of attributes, to obtain data that allows transactions or user behaviour to be tracked, linked or correlated, or knowledge of transactions or user behaviour to be otherwise obtained, unless explicitly authorised by the user;

<p>The [CIR 2024/2979] specifies the following requirements related to transaction logs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Wallet Unit shall log data related to transactions,</li>
<li>the log shall at least contain:</li>
<li>the time and date of the transaction;</li>
<li>the name, contact details, and the unique identifier of the corresponding wallet-relying party and the Member State in which that wallet-relying party is established, or in case of other wallet units, relevant information from the wallet unit attestation;</li>
<li>the type or types of data requested and presented in the transaction;</li>
<li>in the case of non-completed transactions, the reason for such non-completion</li>
<li>the transaction logs should allow investigating of suspicious behaviour of Relying Parties, PID and Attestation Providers, </li>
<li>the transaction log shall be protected to preserve integrity, authenticity and confidentiality,</li>
<li>the transaction log shall be included in User's data backup and recovery processes, as well as migration from one Wallet Unit to another,</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the Regulation, including the recitals and the articles that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (11)</strong></p>
<p><em>Logging transactions is an important tool to provide transparency, in the form of providing an overview of the transactions to the wallet user. Furthermore, logs should be used to enable the swift and easy sharing of certain information, at the request of the wallet user, with the competent supervisory authorities established pursuant Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in case of suspicious behaviour of wallet-relying parties.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (13)</strong></p>
<p><em>Data export and portability objects can log the person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes that have been issued to a particular wallet unit. These objects allow wallet users to extract the relevant data from their wallet unit in order to strengthen their right to data portability. Wallet providers are encouraged to use the same technical solutions to also implement backup and recovery processes for wallet units, making it possible to recover lost wallet units or to transfer information from one wallet provider to another, where appropriate and insofar as this can be done without impairing the right to data protection and the security of the digital identity ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 9</strong></p>
<p><em>Transaction logs</em></p>
<p><em>1. Irrespective of whether or not a transaction is successfully completed, wallet instances shall log all transactions with wallet-relying parties and other wallet units, including electronic signing and sealing.</em></p>
<p><em>2. The logged information shall at least contain:</em></p>
<p><em>(a) the time and date of the transaction;</em></p>
<p><em>(b) the name, contact details, and the unique identifier of the corresponding wallet-relying party and the Member State in which that wallet-relying party is established, or in case of other wallet units, relevant information from the wallet unit attestation;</em></p>
<p><em>(c) the type or types of data requested and presented in the transaction;</em></p>
<p><em>(d) in the case of non-completed transactions, the reason for such non-completion.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Wallet providers shall ensure integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the logged information.</em></p>
<p><em>7. Wallet providers shall enable wallet users to export the logged information referred to in paragraph 2.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-discussion">3 Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="31-introduction">3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This topic has been discussed already in the context of Topic N - Export and Data Portability. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/n-export-and-data-portability.md">Discussion Paper</a> for more. The outcome of that discussion has been taken into account in this paper.</p>
<h3 id="32-the-scope-of-logging">3.2 The scope of logging</h3>
<p>According to Recital (13) of [European Digital Identity Regulation]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It should allow users to track all transactions executed through the European Digital Identity Wallet with at least the following data: the time and date of the transaction, the counterpart identification, the personal data requested and the data shared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or Article 9 of [CIR 2024/2979]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>2. The logged information shall at least contain:</em></p>
<p><em>(a) the time and date of the transaction;</em></p>
<p><em>(b) the name, contact details, and the unique identifier of the corresponding wallet-relying party and the Member State in which that wallet-relying party is established, or in case of other wallet units, relevant information from the wallet unit attestation;</em></p>
<p><em>(c) the type or types of data requested and presented in the transaction;</em></p>
<p><em>(d) in the case of non-completed transactions, the reason for such non-completion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>the scope of logged data is not closed and provides possibility to log more data. </p>
<p>The need to log additional data may be related for instance to:
- PID and Attestation deletion events,
- sending reports to DPAs, 
- User's data export and import processes and Wallet Unit migrations,
- qualified electronic signatures and seals generated by or through the Wallet Unit.</p>
<p>Therefore it is justified and necessary that Wallet Units logs more data than literally listed in the above mentioned legal acts.</p>
<p>The ARF defines the following events to be logged:
- all types of transaction executed through the Wallet Unit: issuance and re-issuance transactions, presentation transactions, signature and seal creation transactions, attribute deletion requests sent to a Relying Party, and complaints lodged with a Data Protection Authority (DASH_02, DASH_2a, DASH_03, DASH_04, DASH_05, Mig_01),
- transactions related to qualified electronic signatures and seals generated by or through the Wallet Unit (QES_13),
- sending reports to DPAs (RPT_DPA_05),
- attribute deletion requests (DATA_DLT_05, DATA_DLT_06).</p>
<p>At the same time, as the result of discussion on Topic N, the scope of logged information is to cover also PID or Attestation deletion events (update of DASH_02). </p>
<p>Therefore, at this stage, general questions may be raised:
- <strong>Are there any other types of events that should be logged?​</strong>
- <strong>Are there types of events that should NOT be logged?</strong></p>
<p>Basing on the feedback, no changes to HLRs are proposed.</p>
<h3 id="33-the-level-of-detail-and-privacy-protection">3.3 The level of detail and privacy protection</h3>
<p>Recital (32) of [European Digital Identity Regulation] </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To ensure privacy, European Digital Identity Wallet providers should ensure unobservability by not collecting data and not having insight into the transactions of the users of the European Digital Identity Wallet. Such unobservability means that the providers are not able to see the details of the transactions made by the user. However, in specific cases, on the basis of explicit prior consent by the user in each of those specific cases, and fully in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providers of European Digital Identity Wallets could be granted access to the information necessary for the provision of a particular service related to European Digital Identity Wallets.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>as well as Article 5a(16) </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The technical framework of the European Digital Identity Wallet shall:
(a) not allow providers of electronic attestations of attributes or any other party, after the issuance of the attestation of attributes, to obtain data that allows transactions or user behaviour to be tracked, linked or correlated, or knowledge of transactions or user behaviour to be otherwise obtained, unless explicitly authorised by the user;
[...]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>require that the details of transactions shall not be visible to or accessible by Wallet Providers, which may be interpreted that the transaction log:
- should not contain details of transactions, or
- if such details are logged, they should be protected from being accessed by the Wallet Provider (or any actor other than the User) w/o an explicit consent of the User (and given separately for each specific case).</p>
<p>Currently the ARF already specifies number of detailed information that is to be logged, for instance in the requirements DASH_02, DASH_03 and other (see section 4). Therefore the ARF envisions User's consent, as defined in DASH_10:</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>DASH_10</td>
<td>The Wallet Unit SHALL make the logs accessible to the Wallet Provider if this is necessary for the provisioning of the Wallet Unit, and only after obtaining explicit consent from the User via the dashboard.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To conclude, at this stage, general questions may be raised:
- <strong>Are there any situations that may require refraining from logging of (some) transaction details?​</strong>
- <strong>Are the current HLRs sufficient in this context?</strong></p>
<p>Basing on the feedback, the following changes HLRs are proposed:
- adding intended use information to the trasaction log (modification of DASH_03), 
- introducing a new HLR to clarify that actual data like attributes values or transactional data content shall not be logged (DASH_03a).</p>

<h3 id="34-pseudonyms">3.4 Pseudonyms</h3>
<p>[European Digital Identity Regulation] (eg. Recital (19), Article 5) gives the right to Users to use pseudonims in transactions with the Wallet.</p>
<p>In ARF, this is addressed by the [Topic 11]. In particular, as presented in PA_08 </p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>the user shall be able to review all the transactions where the pseudonyms were used.</p>
<p>Therefore, for clarity and consistency, it is proposed to mention "pseudonym transactions" as part of the scope of transaction log in the HLR DASH_02. At the same time, it is proposed to update PA_08, to replace "SHOULD" with "SHALL".</p>

<h3 id="35-transaction-log-security">3.5 Transaction log security</h3>
<p>Referring again to Recital (32) and Article 5a(16) of [European Digital Identity Regulation] (see section 3.2), as well as Article 9(3)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>3. Wallet providers shall ensure integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the logged information.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>the transaction log shall be protected.</p>
<p>In the current ARF (taking into account changes resulting from Topic N related discussion), there are requirements DASH_06 and Mig_05: </p>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>that refers to protecting the transaction log and Migration Object (that contains also the transaction log) used in a Wallet Unit migration scenarios. </p>
<p>In this context we can imagine, that depending on the Wallet Solution architecture, the transaction logs can be stored:
- locally in a Wallet Unit,
- in a remote location - in case of a cloud-based Wallet Solution or due to security management reasons possibly (backup, archiving, audit purposes). </p>
<p>Therefore, at this stage, a general question may be raised:
- <strong>Is there a need for additional HLR(s) to address protection of transaction log itself?</strong></p>
<p>Following the feedback, the current HLRs are sufficient in this respect and no additional ones are proposed.</p>
<h3 id="36-log-format">3.6 Log format</h3>
<p>To enable migration between Wallet Units from different Wallet Solutions/Wallet Providers, the log format should be specified in a Technical Specification. Therefore, as part of the Topic N discussion, it was proposed to add a new HLR, as below:</p>
<table>

<p>The above requirement is being introduced to ARF.</p>
<h2 id="4-current-hlrs-and-proposals-of-changes">4 Current HLRs and Proposals of Changes</h2>
