<h1 id="annex-2-high-level-requirements">ANNEX 2 - High-Level Requirements <!-- omit from toc --></h1>
<h2 id="a2-high-level-requirements">A.2 High-level requirements</h2>
<h3 id="a21-introduction">A.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="a211-overview">A.2.1.1 Overview</h4>
<p>This annex to the <a href="../../../architecture-and-reference-framework-main/">ARF main document</a>
includes high-level requirements (HLRs) related to the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.
The requirements define the responsible actor that should implement each
requirement. There are no requirements imposed on the Users.</p>
<p>All requirements in this Annex only apply in the context of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem. Attestations that are not bound to Wallet Units, as described in
<a href="../../../architecture-and-reference-framework-main/#6638-relying-party-instance-verifies-device-binding">Section 6.6.3.8 of the ARF main document</a>, are not included in the scope of this Annex.</p>
<h4 id="a212-key-words">A.2.1.2 Key words</h4>
<p>This Annex uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>, i.e., to
indicate requirements, recommendations and options specified in this annex.</p>
<p>In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e., a requirement that is not mandated by this document,
but, for instance, by an external standard or specification. The word
'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', and
'is' or 'are', are intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="a22-structure-and-order-of-presentation-of-the-hlrs">A.2.2 Structure and order of presentation of the HLRs</h3>
<p>Topics presented in <a href="#a23-high-level-requirements">Section A.2.3</a> are ordered by
a Topic number.</p>
<p>Each Topic includes a short description, followed by the High-Level
Requirements (HLRs), identified by a unique identifier. The identifier
includes a prefix which signifies the context of the HLRs (e.g. ISSU
for issuance), an underscore and a numerator, e.g. ISSU_10.</p>
<h3 id="a23-high-level-requirements">A.2.3 High-Level Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="a231-topic-1-accessing-online-services-with-a-wallet-unit">A.2.3.1 Topic 1 - Accessing Online Services with a Wallet Unit</h4>
<h5 id="description">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>One of the main use cases of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem is to enable Users to access
online services and to enable Relying Parties offering such services to, where needed, identify
and authenticate Users with a high level of assurance. This essential
functionality ensures that Relying Parties can confidently verify that they are
interacting with the correct User.</p>
<p>Note: As specified in the [European Digital Identity Regulation], legally speaking, the term 'Relying Party' also include QEAA Providers, PuB-EAA Providers,
and non-qualified EAA Providers. However, for clarity this Annex uses the term 'Relying Party' exclusively in the meaning of a service provider interacting with a Wallet Unit to request and receive attributes from an attestation.</p>
<p>In this use case, a User is using their Wallet Unit to present attributes in order to access online services offered by Relying Parties. The User is concerned about presenting such attributes during online interactions. Their objectives include maintaining control
over the presentation of personal attributes from PIDs and attestations.</p>

<p>Relying Party authentication is a process whereby a Relying Party proves
its identity to a Wallet Unit, in the context of a transaction in
which the Relying Party requests the Wallet Unit to release some
attributes.</p>
<p>To perform Relying Party authentication, the Wallet Unit verifies a
Relying Party Instance access certificate offered by the entity with which it
communicates, which is called a "Relying Party Instance". Note that
there could be multiple Relying Party Instances for each Relying Party.</p>
<p>The Wallet Unit communicates the outcome of Relying Party authentication to the
User when it requests the User for approval to present the requested attributes.
High-level requirements for User approval are also included in this Topic. If requested by the User, the Wallet Unit also communicates the outcome of the verification of the information in the Relying Party registration certificate or obtained from the Registrar, see
<a href="#a2344-topic-44---relying-party-registration-certificates">Topic 44</a>. The Wallet Unit also informs the User about the outcome

<p>There are no HLRs for this Topic.</p>
<h4 id="a239-topic-9-wallet-unit-attestation">A.2.3.9 Topic 9 - Wallet Unit Attestation</h4>
<p>Note to this Topic: The Commission received many comments on
the ideas described in this Topic, particularly relating to revocation and
the differing needs of Relying Parties on one side and
PID Providers and Attestation Providers on the other.
Further details on these subjects will be provided in <a href="./technical-specifications/ts3-wallet-unit-attestation.md">Technical Specification 3</a>
and the high level requirements in Topic 9 intentionally do not go into these technical details.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: <a href="./technical-specifications/ts3-wallet-unit-attestation.md">Technical Specification 3</a> is not finalised yet. Discussions on the WUA are ongoing. In particular, no final decision has been taken yet regarding the use of a WUA on the Relying Party interface. Nevertheless, it seems likely that this will not be a possibility, and that a Wallet Unit will send a WUA only to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider during issuance.</strong></p>
<h5 id="description_6">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>When a User's Wallet Unit interacts with other actors
in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, in particular PID Providers, Attestation Providers,
or Relying Parties, these actors may want to verify if the Wallet Unit is  authentic and has not been revoked. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when a PID Provider or Attestation Provider receives a request from a
User to issue a PID or attestation to the User's Wallet Unit,
the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to decide whether it can
comply with this request. To determine this, the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider needs to know (among other things) if the Wallet
Unit offers the functional capabilities required by the PID Provider
or Attestation Provider in its PID or attestation issuing policy. In
addition, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to know if the
Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application(s) (WSCA) and the corresponding
Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device(s) (WSCD) that are part of the Wallet Unit
offer the required level of security. Therefore, the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider needs to receive trustworthy information about
these capabilities and security posture.</p>
<p>This Topic introduces an information object that contains the necessary
information to allow PID Providers and Attestation Provider to verify if he Wallet Unit is  authentic and has not been revoked, and that also contains the information needed by the Provider to take a decision on issuance. This object is called the Wallet Unit
Attestation (WUA). The WUA also contains a public key. By including this public
key in the WUA, the Wallet Provider attests that the corresponding private key is
protected by a certified WSCA/WSCD that has the properties and security posture
described in the WUA. The PID Provider or Attestation Provider then asks the Wallet Unit to create a key
pair for its new PID or attestation, and to prove that both this new private key and the
private key corresponding to public key in the WUA are in possession of the Wallet Unit.</p>
<p>Regarding the manner in which a Relying Party (as opposed to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider) may be able to verify if he Wallet Unit is authentic and has not been revoked, please refer to <a href="#a2318-topic-18---combined-presentations-of-attributes">Topic 18</a>.</p>
<p>A topic related to the WUA is the following. It would be useful for the Wallet Unit to be able to provide a proof that the PID or attestation private key is protected by the same WSCA as the WUA private
key. Because if that is the case, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider can be sure that the
security level of the new PID or attestation key is the same as the security
level of the WUA key. Moreover, such a proof could also be useful in case of a combined presentation of attributes as discussed in <a href="#a2318-topic-18---combined-presentations-of-attributes">Topic 18</a>, to give assurance to the Relying Party that multiple attestations originate from the same WSCA/WSCD and thus are related to the same User.</p>
<p>However, at the moment of writing this version of the ARF, no commonly agreed technical specification of such a proof is available. Moreover, even if such a specification were available, it is
not fully clear how many WSCAs/WSCDs available to Wallet Units will support the cryptographic functionalities
necessary to generate such a proof. Therefore, creating such a proof is recommended (SHOULD), not required (SHALL). In this way, once a Wallet Unit includes a WSCD/WSCA that supports the required cryptographic functionalities, such a proof can be used as described in this Topic.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Commission will ensure a technical specification for such a proof is created in the future.</li>
<li>In earlier versions of the ARF, this proof was called a 'proof of association'. However, this is also the name commonly used for one of the proposals for implementing such a proof. To avoid confusion, this version of the ARF does not use this term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the scope of this Topic is limited to the question
of how the WUA is issued during Wallet Unit activation and how it is
used during PID or attestation issuance.</p>

<h4 id="a2311-topic-11-pseudonyms">A.2.3.11 Topic 11 - Pseudonyms</h4>
<h5 id="description_8">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>Wallet Units will support generating pseudonyms for Users in compliance with the
W3C WebAuthn API specification, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/">W3C WebAuthn</a>. On a high level, this means that
the WSCD in the Wallet Unit will be able to create key pairs. The public keys of
these pairs function as pseudonyms for the User. Only the User can use these
pseudonyms, since the WSCD authenticates the User before allowing a pseudonym to
be used, see requirement WIAM_14. The Wallet Unit will keep an internal structure
to associate each pseudonym (public key) with a specific Relying Party, based on
the Relying Party unique identifier in the Relying Party Instance access
certificate mentioned in requirement Reg_32.</p>
<p>Pseudonyms were discussed with Member States in Topic E. These
discussions included the use cases for which Wallet Units must support
pseudonyms and the HLRs for the technical specification of how it must be
implemented. The below HRLs are the result of this discussion. For more
background information on these requirements, please refer to the <a href="../../../discussion-topics/e-pseudonyms-including-user-authentication-mechanism/">Discussion
Paper for Topic E</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: As specified in requirement PA_21, the Commission will create or reference a technical specification containing a profile or extension of the [W3C WebAuthn] specification. The HLRs below are in fact requirements to be fulfilled by this technical specification. Discussions on the pseudonyms are ongoing.</strong></p>

<h5 id="description_9">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>Article 45e of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] sets up the legal
basis for the Commission to "where necessary, establish specifications and
procedures for the catalogue of attributes and schemes for the attestation of
attributes and verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of
attributes". As described in <a href="../../../architecture-and-reference-framework-main/#56-catalogues">Section 5.6 of the ARF main document</a>, these 'schemes for the
attestation of attributes' will be described in so-called Attestation Rulebooks.
A separate Rulebook will be created for each type of attestation. This Topic
describes the high-level requirements for the Attestation Rulebooks that will
specify the details of new types of attestations.</p>
<p>Attestation Rulebooks will be written by Attribute Schema Providers, a role
which can be assumed by different types of organisation. The goal of this Topic
is to ensure that all Rulebooks that will be written in the future will contain
the same type of information and the same level of detail, such that all
attestations are interoperable.</p>
<p>Attestation Rulebooks may be registered and published in a publicly accessible
catalogue, as described in <a href="#a2325-topic-25---unified-definition-and-controlled-vocabularies-for-attributes">Topic 25</a>.</p>

<h4 id="a2318-topic-18-combined-presentations-of-attributes">A.2.3.18 Topic 18 - Combined presentations of attributes</h4>
<h5 id="description_12">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>This Topic discusses the combined presentation of attributes by a Wallet
Instance to a Relying Party. 'Combined presentation' here refers to a
transaction in which the Relying Party requests attributes of the same User from
multiple attestations (PID and/or (Q)EAAs) in a single request and receives
those attributes in a single response. These attestations can have been provided
to the Wallet Unit by one or by multiple PID Providers or Attestation Providers.</p>
<p>This Topic answers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can a Relying Party request for a combined presentation of attributes?</li>
<li>How can a Wallet Unit receiving such a request present the attributes in a
combined manner?</li>
<li>How can the Relying Party verify the authenticity of all released attributes
in a combined response?</li>
<li>How can the Relying Party verify whether all released attributes were issued
to the same User?</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the last question:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject may be either a natural person or a legal person.</li>
<li>However, use cases such as delegation or legal representation, where
 the Relying Party may request attributes that are originally part of
 multiple distinct attestations that were not issued to the same User,
 are not combined presentations and are out of scope of this Topic.</li>

<h4 id="a2320-topic-20-strong-user-authentication-for-electronic-payments">A.2.3.20 Topic 20 - Strong User authentication for electronic payments</h4>
<h5 id="description_14">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>This topic deals with the requirement for Strong User (Customer) Authentication
(SCA) in the context of authenticating a User as part of electronic payments.  </p>
<p>Users would like to be able to authenticate themselves during online
payments securely and conveniently using their Wallet Units, so that
they can enjoy a seamless and protected shopping/ payment experience.  </p>
<p>The goal is to implement Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for electronic
payments, ensuring a high level of security and compliance with
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj#d1e5540-35-1">Article 97 of the PSD2</a>
(and with the future PSD3/PSR).</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj">Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389</a>
lays down the requirements for strong customer authentication (SCA), which needs
to be complied with when accessing a payment account online and for initiating
electronic payments, or carrying out any action through a remote channel which
may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses. The use of the wallet for SCA
will be in full compliance with those requirements.  </p>
<p>In the future, a Wallet Unit could also be used for payments with Central Bank
Digital Currencies.  </p>

<h5 id="description_16">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>In this use case, the User is using their Wallet Unit for identification
purposes in proximity scenarios. As explained in <a href="../../../architecture-and-reference-framework-main/#442-proximity-presentation-flows">Section 4.4.2 of the ARF main document</a>, in a
proximity flow, the User and their Wallet Instance are physically near the
Relying Part Instance. PIDs and attestations are exchanged using proximity
technology (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth) between the Wallet Unit and the Relying Party
Instance. Note that this definition does not imply that a Wallet Unit and a
Relying Party have to use proximity technologies if they are close together.
They are free to use a remote flow (according to <a href="#a231-topic-1---accessing-online-services-with-a-wallet-unit">Topic 1</a>).
However, there may be situations where either the Wallet Unit or the Relying
Party Instance does not have an internet connection. In such cases, they must be
able to use a proximity flow, if they are close together.</p>
<p>The User is concerned
about sharing personal data in proximity, while the User's objectives
include identifying themselves to services requiring User identification
and maintaining control over their personal data sharing.</p>

identification in proximity use cases where Users utilise their Wallet Units.</p>

<ul>
<li>Registration of an Attestation Rulebook in the attestation catalogue is not mandatory.</li>
<li>Registration in the Attestation Rulebook catalogue does not create any

<h4 id="a2328-topic-28-wallet-unit-for-legal-persons">A.2.3.28 Topic 28 - Wallet Unit for legal persons</h4>
<p>Note to this Topic: Legal-person PIDs and Wallet Units for legal persons were
added to the list of topics to be discussed with Member States in the future.</p>
<h5 id="description_20">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>This topic is focused on identifying high-level requirements for a legal-person
Wallet Unit. All core capabilities of a Wallet Unit for a natural person are
available for a legal person. There are some differences between a natural and
legal person that accordingly leads to different requirements for issuing
legal-person PIDs and the Wallet Units containing legal-person PIDs.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A legal-person PID is issued under an eID scheme.</li>
<li>A legal-person PID is described in a legal-person PID Rulebook,
 which is different from the natural-person PID Rulebook in [PID
 Rulebook]. A legal-person PID has a different attestation type than
 a natural-person PID, and also contains different attributes. For
 example, date of birth or age are not relevant information for legal
 persons. Specifying a different Rulebook for legal-person PIDs
 allows Relying Parties and other Wallet Units to request
 these attributes.  </li>
<li>A legal-person Wallet Solution may be implemented in the same
 manner as a natural-person Wallet Solution, meaning chiefly that it
 is implemented on a mobile device operated by a single User, who is
 a natural person. However, a legal-person Wallet Solution may
 also be implemented as a server-based (web-based) application. In
 the latter case, a Wallet Unit can be used either by one or more
 natural persons appointed by the legal person, or by information
 systems of the legal persons that give an Wallet Unit
 commands in accordance with rules defined by the legal person.</li>

<h5 id="description_21">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p><a href="#a233-topic-3---pid-rulebook">Topic 3</a> describes requirements for a rulebook of
natural-person PIDs. <a href="#a2328-topic-28---wallet-unit-for-legal-persons">Topic 28</a>
does the same for legal-persons PIDs.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1347-1-1">Article 5a</a>.5.(f)
of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] also mentions the possibility of
issuing eIDs that also could attest a natural person representing the natural or
legal person.  At current time, this Topic proposes to not describe any
requirements for such eID schemes without further Member State input for such
eID schemes. The main reason is that there is no cross-border legal framework
for mutual recognition of powers and mandates. Powers and mandates are generally
legal system-specific and administrative system-specific.</p>
<p>Another use case for delegation is where the recognition of the power
for a person to represent another person occurs on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis,
based on a decision by the represented User and in the context of a
specific Relying Party. The basis for such decisions is outside the
scope of eIDAS. Various scenarios can be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Natural person to natural person, based on the will of the
 represented person: One individual authorises another individual to
 represent them, for example:
   - Picking up a prescription from the pharmacy or a package from
 the post office for a family member.
   - Empowering a person to vote on your behalf.
   - Empowering a notary to sell your house on your behalf to a
 certain party for a certain amount.
   - Empowering your employer to apply for a residence permit on your
 behalf.</li>
<li>Natural person to natural person, based on some decision by an
 authority, or also as a consequence of national, EU or international
 law.</li>
<li>Legal guardian being able to take decisions on behalf of child,
 disabled person, or elderly person.</li>
<li>Natural person to legal person: An individual authorising a legal
 entity to represent them.</li>
<li>A person empowering a law firm to be the executor of the trust upon their
 death.</li>
<li>A person empowering a bank to invest on their behalf.</li>

<p>F. Requirements for the notification of non-qualified EAA Providers</p>
<p>There is no notification of non-qualified EAA Providers foreseen by the
[European Digital Identity Regulation]. As stated in [<a href="#a2312-topic-12---attestation-rulebooks">Topic 12</a>],
the Schema Provider for an Attestation Rulebook describing a type of attestation

this type of EAA.</p>
<p>G. Requirements for the notification of Access Certificate Authorities and Registrars</p>
<p>Relying Party Access Certificate Authorities (CA) are responsible for
signing access certificates they issue to Relying Parties. Legally speaking,
Relying Parties in this context also include QEAA Providers, PuB-EAA Providers,
and non-qualified EAA Providers, but for clarity these roles are mentioned
separately in the requirements below. Where these requirements use the term
'Access Certificate Authorities' without further qualifications, this includes
Access Certificate Authorities for QEAA Providers, PuB-EAA Providers,
non-qualified EAA Providers, and Relying Parties.</p>

<h4 id="a2333-topic-33-wallet-unit-backup-and-restore">A.2.3.33 Topic 33 - Wallet Unit backup and restore</h4>
<h5 id="description_24">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>Backup and restore functionality is needed in case the User has lost access to
their current Wallet Unit, for example in case of loss, theft, or breakdown. It
is also needed if the User wants to start using another Wallet Unit, for example
because they have bought a new device, need to factory-reset their existing
device, or want to migrate to another Wallet Solution. In all of these cases,
the User wants to restore the PIDs and attestations in their existing Wallet
Unit on their new Wallet Unit, with as minimal an effort as possible.</p>
<p>The [European Digital Identity Regulation] does not contain a requirement
mandating backup and restore functionality in the Wallet. However, Wallet
Providers should implement backup and restore functionality nevertheless,
because it will be expected by Users. In fact, the requirements in <a href="#a2334-topic-34---migrate-to-a-different-wallet-solution">Topic 34</a>
also ensure the possibility of backup and restore.</p>

<h4 id="a2334-topic-34-migrate-to-a-different-wallet-solution">A.2.3.34 Topic 34 - Migrate to a different Wallet Solution</h4>
<h5 id="description_25">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>Article 5a 4 (g) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] ensures the
User's rights to data portability. Data portability means that a User can
migrate to a different Wallet Solution. The User installs an instance of the new
Wallet Solution, and then wants to restore the PIDs and attestations in their
existing Wallet Unit to their new Wallet Unit. This should be possible with as
minimal an effort as possible, and independent of whether the User still has
access to their existing Wallet Unit.</p>
<p>The solution described in this Topic is to introduce a Migration Object in each
Wallet Unit. This object is a list of PIDs and attestations contained in the
Wallet Unit, together with the information needed to request (re-)issuance of
that PID or attestation. Note that the Migration Object does not contain any
private keys of PIDs or attestations. In most security
architectures for a Wallet Solution described in <a href="../../../architecture-and-reference-framework-main/#45-wscd-architecture-types">Section 4.5 of the ARF main document</a>, this is
impossible, since the WSCA/WSCD that contains these private keys does not allow
their extraction under any circumstances. An exception may be architectures in
which attestation private keys are managed in a remote HSM and the migration is
to a new Wallet Unit of the same Wallet Provider. However, in such cases,
restoring functionality of the PIDs and attestations in a new Wallet Unit does
not necessitate that private keys must be exported to another HSM. Rather, it
implies the User must be able to authenticate towards the existing HSM from the
new Wallet Unit, and be recognised as an existing User.</p>
<p>The fact that the Migration Object does not contain private keys means that PIDs
and attestations cannot be backed up and restored from the object in such a way
that they are usable in a new Wallet Unit without involvement of the PID
Provider or Attestation Provider. Instead, the User must ask the respective PID
Provider(s) or Attestation Provider(s) to re-issue the PID(s) or attestation(s)
to the new Wallet Unit. The only function of the Migration Object is to simplify
this process by listing the PIDs and attestations present in the existing Wallet
Unit, together with the information needed by the new Wallet Unit to start the
re-issuance process.</p>
<p>The Migration Object does not contain attribute values or attribute identifiers,
as that data is considered sensitive and is not useful anyway because of the
limitations explained above. Instead, the object only contains a list of
attestation types and the related Attestation Providers. However, even this
limited information may be considered sensitive in some cases. Therefore, the
Migration Object is stored in such a way that its confidentiality is ensured and
that it can be used only by the User.</p>

<h4 id="a2338-topic-38-wallet-unit-revocation">A.2.3.38 Topic 38 - Wallet Unit revocation</h4>
<h5 id="description_27">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>This Topic discusses Wallet Unit revocation. In particular, it answers the
following questions: - How can a Wallet Provider revoke a Wallet Unit? - During
issuance of an attestation, how can an Attestation Provider verify whether a
Wallet Unit has been revoked? - When requesting attributes from an attestation, how
can a Relying Party verify whether a Wallet Unit has been revoked?</p>
<p>Related to the last question, [CIR 2024/2977], Article 5, 4.(b) says "Where providers of person identification data revoke person identification data issued to wallet units, they shall do so (...) where the wallet unit attestation to which the person identification data was issued to has been revoked". This implies that if a Relying Party verifies that a PID it obtained from a Wallet Unit is valid (i.e., not revoked), it can trust that the Wallet Unit is also valid. Consequently, there is no need for a separate mechanism that would allow the Relying Party to verify the revocation status of a Wallet Unit directly with the Wallet Provider. Although the CIR requires this mechanism only for PIDs, other Attestation Providers may similarly revoke an attestation if the Wallet Unit on which it resides is revoked. Note that if an Attestation Provider does not support this, a Relying Party obtaining an attestation from a Wallet Unit has no way of knowing whether the Wallet Unit is revoked. Depending on the value of the attestation, this risk may be acceptable for the Relying Party. </p>
<p>In case of a security issue, Article 5e of the [European Digital Identity
Regulation] requires Wallet Providers to first suspend a Wallet Unit and to
revoke it only if the issue cannot be solved within three months. However, the
suspension of a Wallet Unit is an administrative process, which does not imply
that the WUAs of that Wallet Unit need to be suspended, as opposed to being
revoked. Instead, if the Wallet Provider administratively suspends a Wallet
Unit, it will immediate revoke all corresponding WUAs. If (within three months)
the situation is remedied and the Wallet Unit can be re-instated, the Wallet
Provider will issue one or more new WUAs to the Wallet Unit.</p>

<h5 id="description_31">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>This topic identifies high-level requirements for Relying Party registration
certificates, which were introduced in Commission Implementing Regulation
2024/2982 [2024/2982]. A registration certificate may be issued by a 
Registrar to a Relying Party during the registration process described in
<a href="#a2327-topic-27---registration-of-pid-providers-providers-of-qeaas-pub-eaas-and-non-qualified-eaas-and-relying-parties">Topic 27</a>.
If present, it contains mainly the list of attributes registered by the Relying Party
according to Article 5b 2 (c) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation], as well as information about the intermediary used by this Relying Party, if applicable. A
registration certificate is signed by the Registrar.
As a Relying Party is obliged to register for each purpose ("intended use") separately, a single Relying Party may be issued multiple registration certificates.</p>
<p>Commission Implementing Regulation 2024/2982 requires a Wallet Unit to
authenticate and validate the registration certificate (if available), and to display to the User the information on the Relying Party as registered by the Registrar. The information in the registration certificate can also be retrieved from the Registrar's online service). This enables Users
to verify that the attributes being requested by the Relying Party are within
the scope of their registered attributes ("intended use"), providing assurance that the request is legitimate and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Note: A Relying Party may use the services of an intermediary to request data
from a Wallet Unit, see <a href="#a2352-topic-52-relying-party-intermediaries">Topic 52</a>.
However, such intermediaries are required to delete any data they obtain from a
Wallet Unit immediately after sending it to the Relying Party. Data deletion
requests are therefore always sent to the Relying Party, not the intermediary.</p>

<h5 id="description_35">Description <!-- omit from toc --></h5>
<p>This topic lists high-level requirements regarding so-called intermediaries,
which form a special class of Relying Party. Article 5b (10) of the [European
Digital Identity Regulation] states "Intermediaries acting on behalf of relying
parties shall be deemed to be relying parties and shall not store data about the
content of the transaction". Such an intermediary is a party that offers
services to Relying Parties to, on their behalf, connect to Wallet Units and
request the User attributes that these Relying Parties need. The intermediary
then performs all necessary verifications, and, if successful, sends the
presented attributes to the intermediated Relying Party. This implies that an
intermediary performs all tasks assigned to a Relying Party in this ARF on
behalf of the intermediated Relying Party.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Discussions on Zero-Knowledge Proofs are ongoing. No specific ZKP has been selected to be supported by components in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.</strong></p>
<p>This topic lists high-level requirements for a Zero-Knowledge Proof scheme to be used within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem as a proof mechanism for PIDs and attestations. A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party
(the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a given statement is
true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the
statement itself. This ensures that the verifier gains no knowledge about how
the prover knows the statement to be true, preserving privacy while enabling trust.</p>
<p>The topic of ZKPs for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem was introduced in the <a href="../../../discussion-topics/g-zero-knowledge-proof/">Discussion Paper for Topic G</a>. The high-level requirements in this Topic were taken from that discussion paper.</p>
