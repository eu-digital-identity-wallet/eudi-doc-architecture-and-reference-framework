<h1 id="annex-1-definitions">ANNEX 1 - Definitions</h1>
<h2 id="a1-introduction">A.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>In the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) many terms are used that need a
precise definition. This Annex contains the definitions of these terms.</p>
<p>In fact, there are three sources for these definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first place, the [European Digital Identity Regulation] defines several
of these terms. For convenience, these definitions are listed in <a href="#a2-definitions-from-the-european-digital-identity-regulation">Section A.2</a>.</li>
<li>Secondly, the adopted Commission Implementing Regulations <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R2977">CIR
2024/2977</a>,
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202402979">CIR 2024/2979</a>,
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202402980">CIR 2024/2980</a>,
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202402981">CIR 2024/2981</a>,
and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202402982">CIR 2024/2982</a>
also contain a list of definitions. Again for convenience, these definitions are
included in <a href="#a3-definitions-from-the-adopted-commission-implementing-regulations">Section A.3</a></li>
<li>Thirdly, in writing the ARF, additional technical terms and corresponding
definitions are used. These are listed in <a href="#a4-additional-definitions-used-in-the-arf">Section A.4</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a2-definitions-from-the-european-digital-identity-regulation">A.2 Definitions from the [European Digital Identity Regulation]</h2>

<p>Note: The technical terms and definitions in Table 3 below are intended to be
defined in such a way that they are aligned with the definitions used in the
[European Digital Identity Regulation] and the Commission Implementing
Regulations in Tables 1 and 2, and should be interpreted as such. In case any
definition in Table 3 contradicts a definition from the [European Digital
Identity Regulation] or the Commission Implementing Regulations, the latter take
precedence.</p>
<p>In some cases, a term has its origin in the context of
a specific Topic in <a href="../../annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/">Annex 2</a>. In
such a case, the topic number appears in brackets following the definition. If
the definition relies on an external source, such as a
standard or a formal publication, that source is mentioned.</p>
