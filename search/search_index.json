Use cases for the EUDI Wallet","text":"<p>The development of EUDI Wallet specifications is steered by use cases that facilitate understanding of user experience while capturing the value proposition and business requirements of the EUDI Wallet. To accomplish this, the eIDAS Expert Group begins by creating service blueprints for each EUDI Wallet use case. These blueprints are visual representations of the various components and processes involved in providing a service to users and serve as a tool for pinpointing potential areas for enhancement, optimising user experience, and streamlining service delivery. These blueprints then act as the basis for establishing use case rulebooks and common specifications for all use cases. The service blueprints of the use case can be found in the annexes as attached documents. It is important to note that the service blueprint documents offer a viable solution for each use case, but alternatives and optional steps do exist. For instance, displaying stored data to which the user has already given consent might be optional. Furthermore, user journeys may differ depending on the chosen implementation approach, such as asynchronous attribute storage or synchronous retrieval. This could affect aspects like providing consent to retrieve and share data. The eIDAS Expert Group has described service blueprints for the following use cases.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#31-identification-and-authentication-to-access-online-services","title":"3.1 Identification and  authentication to access online services","text":"<p>The primary purpose of the EUDI Wallet is to offer secure identification and authentication of users at a high Level of Assurance (LoA) for both public and private online services. This essential functionality ensures that Relying Parties can confidently verify that they are interacting with the correct individual. In this use case, the User is utilising the EUDI Wallet to confirm their identity. They frequently access online services that demand authentication and currently employ multiple methods for identity verification while accessing these services. The User is also concerned about sharing person identification data (PID) during online interactions. Their objectives include identifying themselves with services requiring user identification and maintaining control over personal data sharing. This use case encompasses the entire EUDI Wallet life cycle from the User's viewpoint, from obtaining a valid wallet to identifying and authenticating the user within an online service. The focus of the current description is a workable remote same-device flow (refer to section 6.4), where a natural person User employs a single mobile device for both securing the session and accessing the service's information.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#32-mobile-driving-licence","title":"3.2 Mobile Driving Licence","text":"<p>A significant use case for the EUDI Wallet involves allowing Users to acquire, store, and display a digital document as the mobile Driving Licence (mDL) to prove their driving privileges. In this use case the User employs an EUDI Wallet to present a mDL to a third party like a police officer. The use case description concentrates on proximity supervised and unsupervised flows, which involve scenarios where the User is physically near a Relying Party, and the mDL attribute exchange and disclosure occurs using proximity technologies (e.g. NFC, Bluetooth). The two proximity flows have one significant difference: in the supervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a human Relying Party or under their supervision (who may also use a device); whereas in the unsupervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a machine without human oversight.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#33-other-use-cases","title":"3.3.

The two remote flows differ in one important way. In the remote cross-device flow, the EUDI Wallet User consumes information from the service on another device than the EUDI Wallet device, which is only used to secure the session (for instance using the EUDI Wallet to scan a QR code on a login page to access a bank account on their web browser).
