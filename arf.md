# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Context

On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation[^1]
calling on Member States to work towards the development of a Toolbox
including a technical Architecture and Reference Framework (hereinafter
the ARF), a set of common standards and technical specifications and a
set of common guidelines and best practices.

The Recommendation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis
for the implementation of the proposal for a European Digital Identity
Framework[^2], without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering
with, or prejudging the legislative process.

The Recommendation foresees that the Toolbox is developed by Member
States’ experts in the eIDAS Expert Group[^3] in close coordination with
the Commission and, where relevant for the functioning of the European
Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet infrastructure, other concerned public
and private sector parties.

Following the indicative timeline set out in the Recommendation, a
process and working procedures were agreed on 30 September 2021 and
discussed in a non-paper on a high-level description of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem, proposed by the Commission.

On this basis, an outline was defined providing a more detailed
description of the EUDI Wallet concept, its functionalities and security
aspects and on several core, use cases between October and December
2021. That work resulted in the Outline of the ARF, adopted by the eIDAS
Expert Group in February 2022. The Outline was published on Futurium[^4]
for public feedback. When the feedback period closed on 15 April 2022,
36 stakeholders had provided their feedback on the Outline.

The eIDAS Expert Group has since further developed the concepts and
specifications for the European Digital Identity Framework based on the
Commission’s legislative proposal[^5], and will continue to do so until 
the legislative negotiations have been concluded and implementing acts 
have been adopted.

The eIDAS Expert Group adopted the present document on 26 January 2023.

## 1.2. Purpose of This Document

The purpose of the document is to provide all the specifications needed
to develop an interoperable EUDI Wallet Solution based on common
standards and practices. The document presents a state-of-play of
ongoing work of the eIDAS Expert Group and does not imply any formal
agreement regarding its content or the legislative proposal. This
document will be complemented and updated over time through the process
of establishing the toolbox, as described in Chapter 8. Once completed
the document will describe a comprehensive Architecture and Reference
Framework covering all the specifications needed to implement an
European Digital Identity Wallet Solution.

While chapters 2-4 and 7-8 are descriptive, Chapter 5 and 6 specify
requirements for PID and (Q)EAA Providers and EUDI Wallet Solution
implementers. The capitalised imperatives in the document are used in
accordance with RFC 2119.

The document itself holds no legal value and shall not prejudge the
forthcoming legislative process and the final mandatory legal
requirements for European Digital Identity Wallets. The ARF will be
aligned to the outcome of the legislative negotiations of the proposal
for a European Digital Identity Framework. Only the finally adopted
European Digital Identity Framework Regulation, and the implementing and
delegated acts adopted under that legal basis, will be mandatory.

## 1.3. Use of This Document

This document is mainly meant to be used by the European Commission
developing a reference implementation of an EUDI Wallet and the
consortia piloting the use of the reference implementation in the
context of Large Scale Pilots. Experience of implementing this
specification may lead to improvements of this document, in accordance
with Chapter 8.

### 1.3.1. The Reference Implementation of an EUDI Wallet

The Commission will provide a reference implementation of an EUDI Wallet
in a mobile form factor[^6]. The code for the EUDI Wallet reference
implementation will be provided as open source for re-use by
implementers across Europe. The first implementers will be the projects
selected to carry out Large Scale Pilots (LSPs), following a call for
proposals. The LSP projects will be engaged in the further development
of the reference implementation of an EUDI Wallet. The Commission will
also initially supply central services as needed for the functioning of
the EUDI Wallet reference implementation.

The Commission intends to use the ARF to develop the EUDI Wallet
reference implementation.

### 1.3.2. Guidance for the Large Scale Pilots (LSP)

To support the development of a reference implementation of an EUDI
Wallet and to pilot its usage across different priority use cases, the
Commission launched a call for proposals on 22nd February 2022 under the
Digital Europe Programme to pilot large-scale use cases for the EUDI
Wallet.

The objective of the Large Scale Pilots (LSP) call is to co-fund the
piloting of the EUDI Wallet based on a reference implementation of an
EUDI Wallet, taking into account project specificities, existing
national notified eID and wallet developments and implementation
situations, around the different cross-border use cases involving both
public and private stakeholders.

The ARF will be used by the LSPs to inform and guide pilot system design
and architecture development together with the release of the reference
implementation.

The LSPs are expected to provide feedback on the ARF as they develop and
interact with Relying Party services, Qualified or non-qualified
Electronic Attestations of Attributes (Q)EAA Providers, Person
Identification Data (PID) Providers and Users in meaningful transactions
under the proposed use cases.

# 3. Use cases for the EUDI Wallet

The development of EUDI Wallet specifications is steered by use cases
that facilitate understanding of user experience while capturing the
value proposition and business requirements of the EUDI Wallet. To
accomplish this, the eIDAS Expert Group begins by creating service
blueprints for each EUDI Wallet use case. These blueprints are visual
representations of the various components and processes involved in
providing a service to users and serve as a tool for pinpointing
potential areas for enhancement, optimising user experience, and
streamlining service delivery. These blueprints then act as the basis
for establishing use case rulebooks and common specifications for all
use cases. The service blueprints of the use case can be found in the
annexes as attached documents. It is important to note that the service
blueprint documents offer a viable solution for each use case, but
alternatives and optional steps do exist. For instance, displaying
stored data to which the user has already given consent might be
optional. Furthermore, user journeys may differ depending on the chosen
implementation approach, such as asynchronous attribute storage or
synchronous retrieval. This could affect aspects like providing consent
to retrieve and share data. The eIDAS Expert Group has described service
blueprints for the following use cases. 

## 3.1 Identification and  authentication to access online services 

The primary purpose of the EUDI Wallet is to offer secure identification
and authentication of users at a high Level of Assurance (LoA) for both
public and private online services. This essential functionality ensures
that Relying Parties can confidently verify that they are interacting
with the correct individual. In this use case, the User is utilising the
EUDI Wallet to confirm their identity. They frequently access online
services that demand authentication and currently employ multiple
methods for identity verification while accessing these services. The
User is also concerned about sharing person identification data (PID)
during online interactions. Their objectives include identifying
themselves with services requiring user identification and maintaining
control over personal data sharing. This use case encompasses the entire
EUDI Wallet life cycle from the User's viewpoint, from obtaining a valid
wallet to identifying and authenticating the user within an online
service. The focus of the current description is a workable remote
same-device flow (refer to section 6.4), where a natural person User
employs a single mobile device for both securing the session and
accessing the service's information. 

## 3.2 Mobile Driving Licence 

A significant use case for the EUDI Wallet involves allowing Users to
acquire, store, and display a digital document as the mobile Driving
Licence (mDL) to prove their driving privileges. In this use case the
User employs an EUDI Wallet to present a mDL to a third party like a
police officer. The use case description concentrates on proximity
supervised and unsupervised flows, which involve scenarios where the
User is physically near a Relying Party, and the mDL attribute exchange
and disclosure occurs using proximity technologies (e.g. NFC,
Bluetooth). The two proximity flows have one significant difference: in
the supervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a human
Relying Party or under their supervision (who may also use a device);
whereas in the unsupervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents mDL
attributes to a machine without human oversight.

## 3.3. Other use cases 
In subsequent versions of this document, the following use cases will be detailed as service blueprints:

- *Health*

Easy access to health data is crucial in both national and cross-border
contexts. EUDI Wallet may enable access to patient summary,
ePrescriptions, etc.

- *Educational credentials and professional qualifications*

Providing documents for qualification recognition procedures can be
costly and time-consuming for end Users, companies and employers,
education and training providers, and other academic institutions. For
example, digital diploma attestations could be presented cross-border in
a verifiable, trusted, and consumable format to another education or
training institution or a prospective employer. The EUDI Wallet may be a
repository for educational digital credentials as Electronic
Attestations of Attributes and a means for exchanging them by a learner.

- *Digital Finance*

The EUDI Wallet shall facilitate complying with strong customer
authentication requirements. In line with the Commission’s Retail
Payments Strategy[^7], the use case would be developed in close
coordination with Member States’ advisory groups on retail payments and
the finance industry.

- *Digital Travel Credential*

EUDI Wallet can store Digital Travel Credentials enabling Users to
benefit from more seamless travel.

- *Digital Car Key*

EUDI Wallet can store Digital Car Keys enabling users to hold multiple car keys
in their smart phone and seemlessly share their car with others across Europe.

This work may in future be extended to additional use cases.

# 4. European Digital Identity Wallet Ecosystem

This chapter describes the EUDI Wallet ecosystem as it is foreseen in
the Commission’s legislative proposal.

## 4.1. Roles in the Ecosystem

The roles of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem are described in Figure 1 and
detailed in the following sections.

### 4.1.1. Users of EUDI Wallet

Users of EUDI Wallets use the EUDI Wallet to receive, store and present
attestations (PID, QEAA or EAA) about themselves, including to prove
their identity. Users may create Qualified Electronic Signatures and
Seals (QES) using an EUDI Wallet.

Who can be a User of an EUDI Wallet depends on national law. The use of
an EUDI Wallet by citizens is not mandatory under the legislative
proposal. However, Member States are obliged to offer at least one EUDI
Wallet Solution to their citizens.

### 4.1.2. EUDI Wallet Provider

EUDI Wallet Provider are Member States or organisations either mandated
or recognized by Member States making the EUDI Wallet available for end
Users. The terms and conditions of the mandate or recognition are for
each Member State to determine.

The EUDI Wallet Providers make available to Users through an EUDI Wallet
Solution a combination of several products and Trust Services foreseen
in the legal proposal, which give the User full control over the use of
their Person Identification Data (PID) and Qualified or non-qualified
Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA or EAA), and any other
personal data within their EUDI Wallet. From a technical viewpoint, this
may also imply guaranteeing a User sole control over sensitive
cryptographic material (e.g., private keys) related to the use of these
data in some scenarios, including electronic identification, signature /
seal.

EUDI Wallet Providers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
requirements for EUDI Wallets.

### 4.1.3. Person Identification Data (PID) Providers

PID Providers are trusted entities responsible to:

- verify the identity of the EUDI Wallet User in compliance with LoA
  High requirements,

- issue PID to the EUDI Wallet in a harmonised common format and

- make available information[^8] for Relying Parties to verify the
  validity of the PID.

The terms and conditions of these services are for each Member State to
determine.

PID Providers may e.g., be the same organisations that today issue
official identity documents, electronic identity means, EUDI Wallet
Providers etc. EUDI Wallet Providers may or may not be the same
organisations as PID Providers.

### 4.1.4. Trusted List Providers

The specific status of a role in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem shall be
verified in a trustworthy manner. Such roles are:

- EUDI Wallet Providers

- Person Identification Data Providers

- Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA) providers

- Qualified certificate for electronic signature/seal (QC) providers

- Relying Parties

- Non-qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA) providers

- Non-qualified certificate for electronic signature/seal providers

- Providers of other Trust Services

- Catalogues of attributes and schemes for the attestations of attribute
  providers

Other roles may be necessary and thus need to be defined and explicitly
mentioned depending on the specific role and their criticality for
example the different roles and actors involved with remote signing
processes.

When used, Trusted List[^9] need to provide a registration service for
the relevant entities, maintain a registry and enable third party access
to the registry information. The terms and conditions of entities to
become registered are for each registrar to determine unless specified
in e.g., sectoral rules.

### 4.1.5. Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers

Qualified EAA are provided by QTSPs. The general Trust Framework for
QTSPs apply also to QEAA, but specific rules for this Trust Service need
to be defined as well. QEAA Providers maintain an interface for
requesting and providing QEAAs, including a mutual authentication
interface with EUDI Wallets and potentially an interface towards
Authentic Sources to verify attributes. QEAA Providers provide
information or the location of the services that can be used to enquire
about the validity status of the QEAAs, without having an ability to
receive any information about the use of the attestations. The terms and
conditions of these services are for each QTSP to determine, beyond what
is specified in the eIDAS Regulation.

### 4.1.6. Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers

Non-qualified EAA can be provided by any Trust Service Provider. While
they are supervised under eIDAS, it can be assumed that other legal or
contractual frameworks than eIDAS mostly govern the rules for provision,
use and recognition of EAA. Such other frameworks may cover policy areas
such as driving licences, educational credentials, digital payments,
although they may also rely on qualified Electronic Attestation of
Attributes Providers. For EAA to be used, TSPs offer Users a way to
request and obtain EAA, meaning they need to technically comply with
EUDI Wallet interface specifications. Depending on the domain rules, EAA
providers may provide validity information about EAA, without having an
ability to receive any information about the use of the EAA. The terms
and conditions of issuing EAAs and related services are subject to
sectoral rules.

### 4.1.7. Qualified and Non-Qualified Certificates for Electronic Signature/Seal Providers

Article 6a(3) of COM(2021)281 final requires the EUDI Wallet to enable
the User to create qualified electronic signatures or seals. This goal
can be reached by several ways:

- The EUDI Wallet is certified as a qualified signature/seal creation
  device (QSCD), or

- It implements secure authentication and signature/seal invocation
  capabilities as a part of a local QSCD or a remote QSCD managed by a
  QTSP.

EUDI Wallet interfaces with QSCDs will be further expanded in future
versions of this document.

### 4.1.8. Providers of other Trust Services

EUDI Wallet interaction with providers of other qualified or
non-qualified Trust Services such as timestamps may be further described
in future versions of the ARF.

### 4.1.9. Authentic Sources

Authentic Sources are the public or private repositories or systems
recognised or required by law containing attributes about a natural or
legal persons. The Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI of the
legislative proposal are sources for attributes on address, age, gender,
civil status, family composition, nationality, education and training
qualifications titles and licences, professional qualifications titles
and licences, public permits and licences, financial and company data.
Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI are required to provide
interfaces to QEAA Providers to verify the authenticity of the above
attributes, either directly or via designated intermediaries recognised
at national level. Authentic Sources may also issue (Q)EAA-s themselves
if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. It is up to the
Member States to define terms and conditions for the provisioning of
these services, but according to the minimum technical
specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the verification
procedures for qualified electronic attestations of attributes.

### 4.1.10. Relying Parties

Relying Parties are natural or legal persons that rely upon an
electronic identification or a Trust Service. In the context of EUDI
Wallets, they request the necessary attributes contained within the PID
dataset, QEAA and EAA from EUDI Wallet Users to rely on the EUDI Wallet,
subject to the acceptance by the owner of the Wallet (User) and within
the limits of applicable legislation and rules. The reason for reliance
on the EUDI Wallet may be a legal requirement, a contractual agreement,
or their own decision. To rely on the EUDI Wallet, Relying Parties need
to inform the Member State where they are established and their
intention for doing so. Relying Parties need to maintain an interface
with the EUDI Wallet to request attestations with mutual authentication.
Relying Parties are responsible for authenticating PID and (Q)EAA.

### 4.1.11. Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB)

The EUDI Wallets must be certified by accredited public or private
bodies designated by Member States[^10]. QTSPs need to be audited
regularly by Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). CABs are accredited by
a national accreditation body according to Regulation 765/2008 as
responsible for carrying out assessments on which Member States will
have to rely before issuing a EUDI Wallet or providing the qualified
status to a Trust Service Provider. The standards and schemes used by
CABs to fulfil their tasks to certify EUDI Wallets are specified further
in the Toolbox process.

### 4.1.12. Supervisory Bodies

The supervisory bodies are notified to the Commission by the Member
States, which supervise QTSPs and act, if necessary, in relation to
non-qualified Trust Service Providers.

### 4.1.13. Device Manufacturers and Related Entities

EUDI Wallets will have several interfaces with the devices they are
based on, which may be for the following purposes:

- Local storage.

- Online Internet access.

- Sensors such as smartphone cameras, IR sensors, microphones, etc.

- Offline communication channels such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
  WIFI Aware, Near Field Communication (NFC).

- Emitters such as screens, flashlights, speakers etc.

- Smart cards and secure elements.

For secure cryptographic material storage, specific devices or services
may be interfaced with. Other related entities may be service providers
such as cloud service providers, app store providers etc.

The legal proposal sets constraints (e.g., compliance with LoA High) for
which kinds of devices and services may be used for the purpose of
issuing the EUDI Wallet. Likewise, the availability as well as terms and
conditions of device interface providers and related service providers
will set further constraints for EUDI Wallet Providers.

### 4.1.14. Qualified and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Schema Providers

(Q)EAA Schema Providers publish schemas and vocabularies describing
(Q)EAA structure and semantics. It may enable other entities such as
Relying Parties to discover and validate (Q)EAA. The Commission sets out
the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures for this
purpose. Common schemas, including by sector- specific organisations are
critical for wide-spread adoption of (Q)EAAs.

### 4.1.15. National Accreditation Bodies 

National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) under Regulation (EC) No
765/2008[^11] are the bodies in Member States that performs
accreditation with authority derived from the Member State. NABs
accredit CABs as competent, independent, and supervised professional
certification bodies in charge of certifying products/services/processes
against normative document(s) establishing the requirements (e.g.,
legislations, specifications, protection profiles). NABs monitor the
CABs to which they have issued an accreditation certificate.

## 4.2. Lifecycle of an EUDI Wallet

The legal text defines the EUDI Wallet on a high level of abstraction,
as well as for the EUDI Wallet Providers that carry the legal
obligation to make sure that the inhabitants/residents of a Member State
can get a valid and fully functional EUDI Wallet. The lifecycle of an
EUDI Wallet will have some interactions with the Trusted List Providers
that specify the status of a role in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem in a
trustworthy manner. Developing an Architecture and Reference Framework
that must provide guidance to the development of such EUDI Wallet
requires a more detailed level of abstraction to be efficient and to
yield a sufficiently expressive architecture description to be
prescriptive.

This chapter starts from a minimal object model and defines the
lifecycle of the core concepts: EUDI Wallet Solution, PID, (Q)EAA, and
EUDI Wallet Instance. These are chosen as a starting point because the
joint development of the ARF showed that the lifecycles of these
concepts are closely intertwined, which led to unclear description and
consequently misunderstandings.

*The object model will be extended as required in future versions of the
ARF.*

### 4.2.1. Simplified EUDI Wallet Object Model

Figure 2 below distinguishes the concepts of EUDI Wallet Solution and
EUDI Wallet Instance. An EUDI Wallet Solution is the entire product
and/or service provided by a EUDI Wallet Provider. A EUDI Wallet
Instance is a personal instance of a EUDI Wallet Solution that belongs
to and is controlled by a User.

![Figure 2: Simplified EUDI Wallet Object Model](media/image2.png){ width=100% }
<!-- <img src="media/image2.png" style="width:2.70313in;height:2.37745in" /> -->

*Figure 2: Simplified EUDI Wallet Object Model*

This definition is not prescriptive of form factor, hence depending on
the implementation a EUDI Wallet Instance may consist of a single mobile
app, or a set of local and remote components available to a specific
User.

### 4.2.2. PID and (Q)EAA Lifecycles

The lifecycles of PID and (Q)EAA are essentially identical, however, for
the scope of this description we refer subsequently only to PID. The
text of this section applied to PID applies mutatis mutandis to (Q)EAA.

PID in the context of the EUDI Wallet begins its lifecycle when being
issued to a EUDI Wallet Instance. Please note that this means that the
management of attributes in the Authentic Source (adhering to national
structures and attribute definitions) is outside of the scope of the
ARF.

Note that for certain use cases, the PID may be pre-provisioned, meaning
it is not yet valid when issued, but reaches its validity later. If PID
is issued on or after the validity start date, it is immediately
considered the state directly changes to valid. This means, however,
that PID could be “pre-issued”.

*Figure 3: State-chart of PID*

There are two possible transitions from a valid PID: either it
automatically expires, by passage to the *‘validity end date*’ or it is
actively revoked by its Provider. Expiration and revocation are
essentially independent transitions. Once PID is expired or revoked, it
cannot transition back to valid. Update of PID (i.e., because of a name
change) always requires re-issuing.

### 4.2.3. EUDI Wallet Solution Lifecycle

An EUDI Wallet Solution has a state of its own, as defined by Article
10a of the Regulation. The state of the Solution affects the state of
all EUDI Wallet Instances of that EUDI Wallet Solution. The
**Candidate** state is the first state of a EUDI Wallet Solution. This
means it is fully implemented and the EUDI Wallet Provider requests the
solution to be certified as EUDI Wallet.

If all the legal and technical criteria have been met, including the
certification of the Wallet Solution by CAB(s), then a Member State may
decide to start providing Instances of the Solution to Users. The state
of the Solution becomes “**valid”**. According to Article 6d, Member
State informs the Commission of each change in the certification status
of their EUDI Wallet Solutions. This means the EUDI Wallet Solution can
be officially launched, and Instances of the Solution can be provided to
Users.

![Figure 4: State-chart of Wallet Solution](media/image4.png){ width=100% }
<!-- <img src="media/image4.png" style="width:2.80793in;height:2.68666in" /> -->

*Figure 4: State-chart of Wallet Solution*

Under the legal conditions in Article 10a, paragraph 1, the issuing
Member State can temporarily suspend an EUDI Wallet Solution. This would
for example be the result of a critical security issue on that EUDI
Wallet Solution. This leads to the **suspended** state. Under Article
10a, paragraph 2, the issuing Member State can unsuspend the Wallet
Solution and continue issuance, bringing the Solution back to the
**valid** state. Under paragraph 3, the EUDI Wallet Solution can be
completely withdrawn.

### 4.2.4. EUDI Wallet Instance Lifecycle

A EUDI Wallet Instance starts its life based on a valid EUDI Wallet
Solution. The EUDI Wallet Provider provides a EUDI Wallet Solution to
the User which is considered a Wallet Instance in **operational** state
once installed and activated by the User. Depending on the form factor
and implementation, providing an instance can require several actions,
e.g., installation and initialization in case of a mobile EUDI Wallet.
Such an EUDI Wallet Instance could already be used for non EUDI specific
functions, such as storing loyalty cards or non-personalized train
tickets or any other attestation that does not mandate a binding to a
valid PID.

Once an EUDI Wallet Instance is initialised, it is considered **valid**,
meaning it is recognized by a PID Provider and it holds a valid PID set.
If the PID expires or is revoked, the EUDI Wallet is not automatically
unusable, its state is merely downgraded back to **operational**. This
may affect the validity of a (Q)EAA or a certificate for QES.

![Figure 5: State-chart of Wallet Instance](media/image5.png){ width=100% }
<!-- <img src="media/image5.png" style="width:2.08195in;height:2.53535in" /> -->

*Figure 5: State-chart of Wallet Instance*

It is currently assumed that only the User[^12] will be able to
deactivate a EUDI Wallet Instance. Please note that this is independent
from the possibility of a PID or (Q)EAA Provider to revoke their
attestations.

# 5. Requirements for Issuing PID and (Q)EAA

## 5.1. Person Identification Data

This chapter details the PID set as presented by the EUDI Wallet.

A PID Provider may issue a PID set to the EUDI Wallet and enable the use
of the EUDI Wallet as an electronic identification means when accessing
online and offline services.

The mechanisms through which the PID is generated and provided to the
EUDI Wallet are up to the Member States and are only constrained by
legal requirements such as the requirements of LoA High, GDPR or any
other national or union law.

In the following the data format as presented to the Relying Party will
be described, without any assumptions on how the EUDI Wallet retrieved
or generated this data beforehand.

### 5.1.1 The Dataset

#### 5.1.2.1. Principles for PID set revision

This chapter proposes a revision of the eIDAS optional datasets
specified in eIDAS CIR 2015/1501[^13] and discusses further
specification, data minimization and identifiers.

The revision of the eIDAS optional dataset proposed herein is
constructed based on the following principles:

- No two persons should have the same PID set of mandatory attributes.

- The PID set should at least contain the minimum set of attributes
  specified in eIDAS CIR 2015/1501 as mandatory.

- The mandatory data set is by nature limited to the (narrow)
  intersection of what all Member States can provide for all natural and
  legal persons and what is needed for electronic identification
  purposes.

#### 5.1.1.1. PID Attributes for Natural Persons

The below table provides an overview of the current PID attributes that
are included in the eIDAS framework, and the proposed additional
optional attributes that are suggested to also be included.

| Mandatory eIDAS Attributes | Optional eIDAS Attributes | Possible additional optional attributes                                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Current Family Name**    | **Family Name at Birth**  | **Nationality/Citizenship\***                                                                 |
| **Current First Names**    | **First Names at Birth**  |                                                                                               |
| **Date of Birth**          | **Place of Birth**        | **Optional attributes used at national level, e.g., tax number, social security number etc.** |
| **Unique Identifier**      | **Current Address**       |                                                                                               |
|                            | **Gender**                |                                                                                               |

*Table 2 - Mandatory and optional PID attributes for natural persons*

*\*Nationality/Citizenship – this is a potential multi-value attribute
because citizens may have more than one nationality. However,
Nationality/Citizenship may also be communicated in the form of
(Q)EAA’s, to allow citizens to demonstrate a given nationality, without
updating the PID set or involving the PID Provider.*

Possible additional optional attributes have been added to facilitate a
wider range of authentication options both online and offline as well as
addressing learning from the current eIDAS implementations.

Metadata associated with the PID may additionally detail the date of
issuance and/or expiration, the issuing authority and/or Member State,
information necessary to perform holder binding and/or proof of
possession, the information or location of the services that can be used
to enquire about the validity status of and potentially more
information.

### 5.1.2 Issuing requirements for PID

*Table 4 - Issuing requirements for (Q)EAA*

# 6. Reference Architecture and Flows

The reference architecture represents a set of choices made during the
architecture design process for EUDI Wallet Solutions. These choices
were informed by the need for EUDI Wallet Solutions to support various
scenarios where either the User or the Relying Party, or both, are
offline while providing flexibility for Member States to implement an
EUDI Wallet Solution in various configurations of components.

## 6.1. Design considerations

To limit complexity, the initial EUDI Wallet Solution specifications
will include only a minimum number of solution components that enable
the use of the EUDI Wallet Instance for identification of the User, so
that it can function as an eID means.

The choices herein are neither a reflection of relative importance nor a
long-term commitment. Instead, the selection was guided by factors such
as the availability and maturity of standards and specifications, an
estimation of ease of adoption, and how much flexibility (in terms of
use cases enabled) is afforded by each solution component.

The solution components proposed herein evidence the current expectation
of using the ISO/IEC 23220 standard series, once publicly available, for
future ARF versions.

## 6.2. Architecture Components

The following components have been identified as the building blocks of
the EUDI Wallet architecture needed to implement an EUDI Wallet
Solution:

- **Cryptographic keys management system.** This component is
  responsible to manage and store cryptographic information like the
  private keys generated for instance during the PID issuance process.

- **Attestation exchange Protocol**. This protocol defines how to
  request and present the PID and the (Q)EAA in a secure and privacy
  preserving fashion. The protocol also defines how authentication is
  performed between the Relying Party and the EUDI Wallet Instance, in
  particular the mechanism through which the Relying Party can request
  identification through the EUDI Wallet. The request contains all the
  required information about the Relying Party and the requested data.
  Trust negotiation and mutual authentication are addressed by this
  protocol.

- **Issuance Protocol**. The protocol defines how PID and (Q)EAA should
  be issued and in which formats.

- **Data model**. The data model defines and describes the data elements
  and how they interact with each other and their properties.

- **PID and (Q)EAA schemas**. The attestation schema contains the
  structure and the logical organisation of the data that define the
  properties of the attestation, the attributes of the User. The
  attestation schema also contains additional information including, but
  not limited to, the verification mechanisms, the underlying identity
  assurance, and Trust Framework to which the properties are related,
  and the proof of possession by the legitimate User.

- **PID and (Q)EAA formats**. PID and (Q)EAA formats are used to
  represent the characteristic, quality, right or permission of a
  natural or legal person or of an object, in the form of signed and
  verifiable digital artifacts, containing any additional properties for
  interoperability purposes.

- **Signature formats**. Technical implementation of one or more
  mathematical methods in the form of a digital artifact, aimed at
  demonstrating the authenticity of a digital document, its integrity,
  authenticating the author of a document and optionally also its
  recipient (audience of the document).

- **Trust Model.** Collection of rules that ensure the legitimacy of the
  components and the entities involved in the EUDI Wallet
  infrastructure, covering:

  - User authentication.

  - Issuers identification.

  - Issuers registration.

  - Recognised data models and schemas.

  - Relying Parties’ registration and authentication.

  - Mechanisms to establish the trust in a cross-domain scenario.

> Trust Model components enable the identification of the entities that
> rely on the EUDI Wallet and are instrumental for the authenticity,
> confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of the information.
> Different Trust Models are available based on different rules.
>
> Trusted List is a mechanism under a Trust Model to publish and obtain
> information about authoritative parties, e.g. Issuers of PID, (Q)EAA
> and Relying Parties.

- **Cryptographic suites and mechanisms**. Algorithms and methods that
  secure the data exchange in terms of confidentiality and integrity.

- **Entity identifiers**. unique identifiers for all the elements of the
  data model.

- **Validity status check**. Mechanism to publish and obtain information
  about validity status of, inter alia, PID, (Q)EAA, certificate, etc.

## 6.3. Logical architecture

Where an EUDI Wallet Solution has an application running on a mobile
device, there may be a need for additional trusted components which are
not part of that application but are nevertheless logically part of the
EUDI Wallet. Such a need may arise for various reasons:

- Security: e.g., if a particular device does not have sufficiently
  secure hardware like a secure element, external hardware components
  like smartcards may be needed .

- Re-use of backend systems.

- Re-use of decentralised identity infrastructure.

These trusted components may be: external trusted storage, external or
embedded trusted hardware or other remote EUDI Wallets components. Below
is a conceptual representation of variations in implementing the EUDI
Wallet components:

## 6.4. Types of Flows

This section describes the four types of flows that the EUDI Wallet MUST
support on a general level. The four flows are as follows:

1.  Proximity supervised flow.

2.  Proximity unsupervised flow.

3.  Remote cross-device flow.

4.  Remote same-device flow.

Flows 1 and 2 are related to a scenario where the EUDI Wallet User is
physically close to a Relying Party and the attestation exchange and
disclosure (PID and/or QEAA) should happen using proximity protocols
(NFC, Bluetooth, QR-Code, etc.), without the User having internet
connectivity (note that this does not imply that any other function
aside from transport is possible offline). The two proximity flows
differ in one important way. In the supervised flow, the EUDI Wallet
presents verifiable attributes to, or under supervision of, a human
acting as a Relying Party (who may operate a device of their own). In
the unsupervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents verifiable attributes to
a machine without human supervision.

Flows 3 and 4 are related to a scenario where data exchange should
happen over the Internet. The two remote flows differ in one important
way. In the remote cross-device flow, the EUDI Wallet User consumes
information from the service on another device than the EUDI Wallet
device, which is only used to secure the session (for instance using the
EUDI Wallet to scan a QR code on a login page to access a bank account
on their web browser). In contrast, in the remote same-device flow, the
EUDI Wallet User uses the EUDI Wallet device both for securing the
session and to consume the information from the service.

The User journeys will rely on at least one, and likely a combination,
of the above described four flows. Note that the four flows can be
implemented in multiple ways. The specific implementations are outside
the scope of this text.

Further consideration is particularly warranted with regards to the two
proximity flows as these are possible with or without internet
connectivity. Possible scenarios include:

- the User and Relying Party are both online,

- only the User is online,

- only the Relying Party is online,

- The User and the Relying Party are both offline.

For all the flows described above and specifically for the proximity
unsupervised flow the User authorization is a prerequisite for data
exchange.

The initial PID and EAA configurations are detailed next (configurations
may be added as required in the future).

## 6.5. The Wallet Configurations

### 6.5.1. Rationale

One of the goals of EUDI Wallet development is to harmonise PID and
(Q)EAA across borders. Ideally, this means a very small number of
different technical solutions to limit complexity which facilitates
implementation and adoption. On the other hand, the EUDI Wallet
specification must support a wide range of use cases with differing
requirements. These differences motivate purpose-fit ways to create,
request, and present PID and (Q)EAA. To satisfy these needs, the EUDI
Wallet Solutions will implement configurations. A configuration is a
specific set of constraints and ways to use the EUDI Wallet Solution’s
technical capabilities to manage both the PID set and (Q)EAAs.

The first purpose of a configuration is to link specific EUDI Wallet
capabilities with use case requirements that can be met with these
capabilities. A single configuration should support multiple use cases;
each conforming to the specific configuration to which the PID or (Q)EAA
was issued.

The second and final purpose of a configuration is to provide a tool for
potentially extending the technology stacks and features of EUDI Wallet
Solution specifications. If a use case, or group of use cases, cannot
rely on an existing EUDI Wallet Solution configuration, it introduces a
need to include an additional configuration to support the requirements
that cannot be met with the existing configurations. The governance and
process of how new configurations could be added, is described in
chapter 8.

### 6.5.2. Initial Configurations

EUDI Wallet Solutions will initially support two configurations:

- Type 1 configuration is aimed specifically at use cases where the
  Relying Party relies on guarantees required for the LoA High as
  defined in CIR 2015/1502[^14], to enable cross border identification
  using PID attributes at LoA High. Type 1 configuration is mainly
  designed for purposes of PID.

- Type 2 configuration aims to enable flexibility and additional feature
  support for possible (Q)EAA use cases that cannot be met by Type 1
  configuration (e.g., possibly in areas of health, education
  credentials, …).

Note that the Type 1 configuration is not meant for the PID set only. It
is likely that many (Q)EAAs are used in elevated security areas (e.g.,
finance, health, access to premises) and will have requirements that are
satisfied by Type 1 configuration. If so, these (Q)EAAs will be issued
in accordance with Type 1 configuration.

### 6.5.3. Configuration Requirements

This section sets the requirements for the configurations by comparing
Type 1 and Type 2 configuration across different groups of requirements.
Future versions of this text may expand the table to specify
requirements relating to, for instance, Issuers and Relying Parties.
Note that these requirements are primarily aimed at the first version of
the EUDI Wallet Solution specifications, and that they may change as the
specifications evolve.

The following table defines the requirements applicable to EUDI Wallet
Solution components to support the two configurations.

# 7. The Certification process of EUDI Wallets

Member States, according to Article 6c (3) of the proposal, must
designate accredited CABs which will oversee carrying out conformity
assessment of EUDI Wallets. This designation process should be
harmonised between Member States.

Once this designation has been made, Member States shall communicate to
the European Commission the names and addresses of these public or
private bodies under Article 6c(5) of the proposal.

EUDI Wallet Provider must request (select, contract) one or more
designated CABs to assess and certify the conformity of their EUDI
Wallet against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.

EUDI Wallet certification is conducted by the CAB to evaluate and
certify the conformity of the EUDI Wallet (target of the certification)
against normative document(s) which will be the Art. 6a(11) implementing
act(s) on technical and operational specifications and reference
standards.

The EUDI Wallet shall be certified to ensure conformity assessments but
also security robustness assessment of conformance to a high level of
security. The use of a cybersecurity certification scheme should bring a
harmonised level of trust in the security of EUDI Wallet. The secure
storage of cryptographic material is expected to become subject to
cybersecurity certification too.

The Certification process of EUDI Wallet Providers should leverage, rely
on, and mandate the use of relevant and existing Cybersecurity Act
certification schemes, or parts thereof, to certify the compliance of
wallets, or parts thereof, with the applicable cybersecurity
requirements.

# 8. The Architecture and Reference Framework Development Process

## 8.1. Publication

This document and the backlog items are made publicly available at 
the [EU Digital Identity Wallet repository in GitHub](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework/), where it will be regularly updated according to the workflow described 
in Chapter 8.2.

* https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework/


## 8.2. Update

To ensure steady and fast progress on elaborating and updating this
document, the following process and work methodology is applied.

The eIDAS Expert Group should maintain a backlog, which is a prioritised
list of work items to complete the ARF. The backlog will be updated
based on feedback from the eIDAS Expert Group, LSPs, the Commission or
other stakeholders such as international standardisation organisations.
For instance, feedback from the development of the reference
implementation of an EUDI Wallet and ensuing drafts of detailed
technical specifications may prompt new work items.

The European Commission (DG CONNECT) will organise the work on the
backlog items and will facilitate that work is progressing according to
the expected timeline.

The eIDAS Expert Group will regularly discuss and compare different
proposals regarding technical solutions, recommendations and
requirements related to the relevant backlog issue with a view of
updating the ARF. The eIDAS Expert Group shall in this regard maintain a
list of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), so that it is possible to
keep track of and understand the motivation behind technical decisions
described in the ARF.

Any changes and/or updates to this document shall be agreed by the eIDAS
Expert Group. The eIDAS Expert Group will convene in regular meetings,
with the objective to discuss and approve new release of this document,
as well as updating the development backlog.

This document will be aligned to the outcome of the legislative
negotiations of the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework
with updates being made accordingly.

### 8.2.1. Document versioning

To avoid interoperability issues and changes to the ARF going unnoticed,
version control system and the following semantic versioning scheme will
be used for the ARF.

The ARF document will have a given version number following the format
*MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH*, where:

**MAJOR** version is incremented (i.e., new version), when the ARF
document has undergone significant changes, for example introducing some
breaking changes in the architecture,

**MINOR** version is incremented when new information has been added to
the document or information has been removed from the document, and

**PATCH** version is incremented when minor changes have been made
(e.g., fixing typos).
