# ARF Technical Specifications

## Introduction

The innovative nature of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem has created gaps between
existing standards, technical specifications (STS), and the legal and technical
requirements necessary to support the ecosystem.

To bridge these gaps, the European Commission has established a
standardisation strategy and a structured standardisation process.

## Objective

As part of this process, the EC, in collaboration with the European Digital
Identity Cooperation Group and the European Standards Organisations (ESO), will
lead the drafting of missing technical specifications where a clear need exists
to support EUDI Wallet implementation within a short timeframe.

By streamlining the drafting process, the EC ensures faster implementation while
maintaining quality and compliance. In the long term, ESO, in coordination with
the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group, will be responsible for
updating and evolving these specifications.

## Process

Effective stakeholder engagement is essential for the successful development of
technical specifications. To ensure an inclusive and collaborative approach, a
structured process will allow stakeholders to contribute at various stages.

The drafting process follows five key steps:

1. The **initial draft** of the technical specification is published on GitHub,
outlining its objectives, scope, and context.
2. A **dedicated discussion thread** is created in the
[GitHub discussion area](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions) for each technical specification.
3. The discussion remains open for **three weeks**. While not all comments will
receive direct responses, all input will be carefully considered.
4. **Approximately seven weeks** after the initial draft's publication, the
Commission will release a **revised version** incorporating relevant feedback.
5. The published version remains open for **further comments and refinements**
on GitHub.

## Technical Specifications

The initial drafts of the following technical specifications will be developed
from **March 7, 2025, to August 15, 2025**. Each specification includes links to
its corresponding GitHub discussion area and roadmap issue.

## Tracking All Relevant Standards and Technical Specifications

While the **technical specifications listed above are developed specifically for the EUDI Wallet**, a broader effort is **ongoing to track, analyze, and align all relevant standards—both existing and missing—that impact the EUDI Wallet ecosystem**.

The **[EUDI Wallet Standards and Technical Specifications Repository](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications)** serves as a **centralised resource** for:

- **Gap Analysis**: Identifying **missing or incomplete standards** necessary for the EUDI Wallet.
- **Roadmap Planning**: Defining a **tentative timeline** for addressing gaps and ensuring that relevant standards are ready for potential referencing in **Implementing Acts**.
- **Public Transparency**: Providing a **clear, structured view** of ongoing standardisation work and enabling **stakeholder feedback**.
