## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Discussion Paper topic description

This document is the Discussion Paper for European Digital Identity Cooperation Group
on topic **T - Support and maintenance by the Wallet Provider**

The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:

Are specific requirements necessary to govern support and maintenance of the Wallet? For instance, guidelines could clarify what types of data the Wallet Provider is permitted or prohibited from collecting from Wallet Instances for support and maintenance purposes.

Following the [European Digital Identity Regulation] (EU) 2024/1183 this document discusses high-level technical requirements the ARF should include on Wallet Provider specific maintenance and support functions.

## 1.2 Key words

This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is
mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas
other words, such as 'will' and 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of
fact.

- Chapter 2 introduces support and maintenance expectations set on Wallet Providers based on the existing legislation and the ARF.
