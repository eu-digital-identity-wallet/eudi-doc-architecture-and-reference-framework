# ARF Discussion topics

## Introduction
The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) is in development. To complete the ARF, the commission concluded 21 open items – called topics – need to be addressed and discussed up to end of 2025. This ARF roadmap project provides and overview on these topics, including a planning when they are addressed.

## Focus of the ARF is to establishing high level requirements
The purpose of the ARF is to establish high level requirements for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, to create uniform conditions for the implementation of the legislative act. The ARF also defines the technical specifications, standards and procedures that the Commission shall reference or develop for the purpose of implementing the eIDAS Regulation.

## Process
The process of establishing high level requirements has 5 steps:
1. The discussion paper on the topic is published on GitHub.
2. The discussion paper on the topic contains a number of questions: each question will have a separate response thread in the [discussion area of GitHub](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions).
3. After three weeks the discussion on the topic will be closed. The Commission will not publish any answers to responses on GitHub, but your input will be considered.
4. The Commission will publish a new ARF version on GitHub about seven weeks after publication of the discussion paper, containing an update on the topic.  
5. The published ARF version can be commented on GitHub.
