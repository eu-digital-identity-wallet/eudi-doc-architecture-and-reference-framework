# Discussion topics

## Introduction

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) is currently in development. To
finalise it, the Commission, in collaboration with the European Digital Identity
Cooperation Group (EDICG), has identified 24 open items,referred to as
topics, that must be addressed and discussed by the end of 2025. The ARF roadmap
project outlines these topics and provides a structured timeline for their
resolution.

## Objective

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) defines high-level requirements
for the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet, serving as the foundation for
developing the technical specifications, standards, and procedures referenced by
the European Commission in the implementing acts of the European Digital Identity
Regulation. These elements ensure a consistent and standardised implementation
of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

## Process

The process of defining high-level requirements consists of five steps:

1. A discussion paper on the topic is published on
[GitHub](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/tree/main/docs/discussion-topics)
and [on this page](#topics).
2. The discussion paper includes several questions, each with a dedicated
response thread in the [GitHub discussion area](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions/categories/arf-discussion-topics).
3. The discussion remains open for three weeks, and while responses to all the
comments may not be provided, all input will be carefully considered.
4. Approximately seven weeks after the discussion paper is published, the
Commission will release an updated ARF version on [GitHub](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/releases),
incorporating revisions to the topic.
5. The published ARF version remains open for further comments on GitHub.

The topics are subject to change, and the order of the topics may be adjusted
based on the feedback received during the discussions. The progress of the
discussions can be tracked on the [ARF Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/eu-digital-identity-wallet/projects/36).

## Topics

Topics are organised into three iterations, each focusing on a specific set of
subjects to be included in a major document release. Below is the list of topics
with links to their corresponding discussion papers. The requirements from each
discussion paper will be consolidated and integrated into the major release at
the end of each iteration, ensuring a structured and iterative development
process for the ARF.
