## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Context

On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation[^2]
calling on Member States to work towards the development of a Toolbox
including a technical Architecture and Reference Framework (hereinafter
the ARF), a set of common standards and technical specifications and a
set of common guidelines and best practices.

The Recommendation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis
for the implementation of the proposal for a European Digital Identity
Framework[^3], without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering
with, or prejudging the legislative process.

The Recommendation foresees that the Toolbox is developed by Member
States' experts in the eIDAS Expert Group[^4] in close coordination with
the Commission and, where relevant for the functioning of the European
Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet infrastructure, other concerned public
and private sector parties.

Following the indicative timeline set out in the Recommendation, a
process and working procedures were agreed on 30 September 2021 and
discussed in a non-paper on a high-level description of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem, proposed by the Commission.

On this basis, an outline was defined providing a more detailed
description of the EUDI Wallet concept, its functionalities and security
aspects and on several core, use cases between October and December
2021. That work resulted in the Outline of the ARF, adopted by the eIDAS
Expert Group in February 2022. The Outline was published on Futurium[^5]
for public feedback. When the feedback period closed on 15 April 2022,
36 stakeholders had provided their feedback on the Outline.

The eIDAS Expert Group has since further developed the concepts and
specifications for the European Digital Identity Framework based on the
Commission's legislative proposal[^6], and will continue to do so until 
the legislative negotiations have been concluded and implementing acts 
have been adopted.

The eIDAS Expert Group adopted version 1.2.0 of this document on 21st of June 2023.
As of version 1.3.0, this document has been released as a draft to gather public feedback prior to its adoption by the Expert Group.

### 1.2 Purpose of This Document

The purpose of the document is to provide all the specifications needed
to develop an interoperable EUDI Wallet Solution based on common
standards and practices. The document presents a state-of-play of
ongoing work of the eIDAS Expert Group and does not imply any formal
agreement regarding its content or the legislative proposal. This
document will be complemented and updated over time through the process
of establishing the toolbox, as described in Chapter 9. Once completed
the document will describe a comprehensive Architecture and Reference
Framework covering all the specifications needed to implement a
European Digital Identity Wallet Solution.

While Chapters 2-5 and 8-10 are descriptive, Chapters 6 and 7 specify 
requirements for PID Providers, (Q)EAA Providers, EUDI Wallet Solution 
Providers, Relying Parties and other parties in the EUDI Wallet 
ecosystem. The capitalised imperatives in the document are used in 
accordance with RFC 2119. 

This document itself holds no legal value and SHALL not prejudge the 
forthcoming legislative process and the final mandatory legal 
requirements for European Digital Identity Wallets. This document 
will be aligned to the outcome of the legislative negotiations of the 
proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework. Only the finally 
adopted European Digital Identity Framework Regulation, and the 
implementing and delegated acts adopted under that legal basis, 
will be mandatory.

### 1.3 Use of This Document

This document is mainly meant to be used by the European Commission 
developing a reference implementation of an EUDI Wallet and the 
consortia piloting the use of the reference implementation in the 
context of Pilots. Experience of implementing this specification 
may lead to improvements of this document, in accordance with 
Chapter 9.

#### 1.3.1 The Reference Implementation of an EUDI Wallet

The Commission will provide a reference implementation of an EUDI Wallet
in a mobile form factor. The source code for the EUDI Wallet reference
implementation will be provided as open source for re-use by
implementers across Europe. The first implementers will be the projects
selected to carry out Large Scale Pilots (LSPs), following a call for
proposals. The LSP projects will be engaged in the further development
of the reference implementation of an EUDI Wallet. The Commission will
also initially supply central services as needed for the functioning of
the EUDI Wallet reference implementation.

The Commission intends to use the ARF to develop the EUDI Wallet
reference implementation.

#### 1.3.2 Guidance for the Large-Scale Pilots (LSP)

To support the development of a reference implementation of an EUDI
Wallet and to pilot its usage across different priority use cases, the
Commission launched a call for proposals on 22nd February 2022 under the
Digital Europe Programme to pilot large-scale use cases for the EUDI
Wallet.

The objective of the Large Scale Pilots (LSP) call is to co-fund the
piloting of the EUDI Wallet based on a reference implementation of an
EUDI Wallet, taking into account project specificities, existing
national notified eID and wallet developments and implementation
situations, around the different cross-border use cases involving both
public and private stakeholders.

The ARF will be used by the LSPs to inform and guide pilot system design
and architecture development together with the release of the reference
implementation.

The LSPs are expected to provide feedback on the ARF as they develop and
interact with Relying Party services, Qualified or non-qualified
Electronic Attestations of Attributes (Q)EAA Providers, Person
Identification Data (PID) Providers and Users in meaningful transactions
under the proposed use cases.

## 3 Use cases for the EUDI Wallet

The development of EUDI Wallet specifications is steered by use cases
that facilitate understanding of user experience while capturing the
value proposition and business requirements of the EUDI Wallet. To
accomplish this, the eIDAS Expert Group begins by creating service
blueprints for each EUDI Wallet use case. These blueprints are visual
representations of the various components and processes involved in
providing a service to users and serve as a tool for pinpointing
potential areas for enhancement, optimising user experience, and
streamlining service delivery. These blueprints then act as the basis
for establishing use case rulebooks and common specifications for all
use cases. 

The service blueprints of the use case can be found in the annexes as
attached documents. It is important to note that the service blueprint 
documents offer a viable solution for each use case, but alternatives 
and optional steps do exist. For instance, displaying stored data which 
the user has already approved to release might be optional. Furthermore, 
user journeys may differ depending on the chosen implementation approach, 
such as asynchronous attribute storage or synchronous retrieval. This 
could affect aspects like providing approval to retrieve and release data.

The eIDAS Expert Group has described service blueprints for the following use cases:
* Identification and authentication to access online services, see section 3.13.1,
* Mobile Driving Licence, see section 3.2,
* A number of other use cases that will be detailed in subsequent versions of this document, see section 3.3.


### 3.1 Identification and  authentication to access online services

The primary purpose of the EUDI Wallet is to offer secure identification
and authentication of users at a high Level of Assurance (LoA) for both
public and private online services. This essential functionality ensures
that Relying Parties can confidently verify that they are interacting
with the correct User. 

In this use case, the User is utilising the EUDI Wallet Instance to 
confirm their identity. They access online services that demand
authentication and currently employ multiple methods for identity
verification while accessing these services. The User is also concerned
about sharing person identification data (PID) during online
interactions. Their objectives include identifying themselves with
services requiring user identification and maintaining control over
personal data sharing. 

This use case encompasses the entire EUDI Wallet life cycle from the
User's viewpoint, from obtaining a valid Wallet Instance to identifying and
authenticating the User within an online service. The focus of the
current description is a workable remote same-device flow (refer to
section 7.4), where a natural person User employs a single mobile device
for both securing the session and accessing the service's information. 

PID issuance requirements, PID attribute schema and Trust Infrastructure
details are further detailed in Chapter 6 and Annex A.6.

### 3.2 Mobile Driving Licence
A significant use case for the EUDI Wallet involves allowing Users to 
acquire, store, and display a mobile Driving Licence (mDL) as an 
attestation to prove their driving privileges. In this use case, the 
User employs an EUDI Wallet to present a mDL to a Relying Party 
(e.g., the Traffic Police)[^8]. 

The use case description concentrates on proximity supervised and
unsupervised flows, which involve scenarios where the User is physically
near a Relying Party, and the mDL attribute exchange and disclosure
occurs using proximity technologies (e.g. NFC, Bluetooth). The two
proximity flows have one significant difference: in the supervised flow,
the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a human Relying Party or
under their supervision (who may also use a device); whereas in the
unsupervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a machine
without human oversight.

(Q)EAA issuance requirements, mDL attribute schema and Trust
Infrastructure details are further detailed in Chapter 6 and Annex A.7.

### 3.3 Other use cases 
In subsequent versions of this document, the following use cases will be
detailed as service blueprints:

#### Health
Easy access to health data is crucial in both national and cross-border 
contexts. An EUDI Wallet Instance MAY enable access to patient summary, 
ePrescriptions, etc.

#### Educational credentials and professional qualifications
Providing documents for qualification recognition procedures can be 
costly and time-consuming for end Users, Relying Parties such as companies 
and employers, and (Q)EAA providers such as education and training 
providers or other academic institutions. For example, digital diploma 
attestations could be presented cross-border in a verifiable, trusted, 
and consumable format to another education or training institution or a 
prospective employer. An EUDI Wallet Instance may be a repository for 
educational digital credentials as Electronic Attestations of Attributes 
and a means for exchanging them by a learner.

#### Digital Finance
The EUDI Wallet Solutions SHALL facilitate complying with strong customer 
authentication requirements. In line with the Commission's Retail 
Payments Strategy[^9], the use case would be developed in close 
coordination with Member States' advisory groups on retail payments 
and the finance industry.

#### Digital Travel Credential

EUDI Wallet can store Digital Travel Credentials enabling Users to
benefit from more seamless travel.

This work may in future be extended to additional use cases.

## 4 European Digital Identity Wallet Ecosystem

This Chapter describes the EUDI Wallet ecosystem as it is foreseen in
the Commission's legislative proposal.

### 4.1 Roles in the Ecosystem

The roles of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem are described in Figure 1 and
detailed in the following sections.

10. *Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB)*

11. *Supervisory bodies*

12. *Device manufacturers and related subsystems providers*

13. *(Q)EAA Schema Providers*

14. *National Accreditation Bodies*

#### 4.1.1 Users of EUDI Wallets
Users of EUDI Wallets use the EUDI Wallet instance to receive, store and
present PID, QEAA or EAA about themselves, including to prove their
identity. Users can create Qualified Electronic Signatures and Seals
(QES) using an EUDI Wallet instance.

Who can be a User of an EUDI Wallet depends on national law. The use of
an EUDI Wallet by citizens is not mandatory under the legislative
proposal. However, each Member State SHALL provide at least one European
Digital Identity Wallet within 24 months after the entry into force of
the implementing acts referred to in the Regulation.

#### 4.1.2 EUDI Wallet Providers
EUDI Wallet Providers are Member States or organisations either mandated
or recognized by Member States making the EUDI Wallet available for end
Users. The terms and conditions of the mandate or recognition are for
each Member State to determine.

The EUDI Wallet Providers make available to a User, through an instance
of their EUDI Wallet Solution, a combination of several products and
Trust Services foreseen in the legal proposal, which give the User full
control over the use of their Person Identification Data (PID) and
Qualified or non-qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA or
EAA), and any other personal data within their EUDI Wallet. From a
technical viewpoint, this may also imply  guaranteeing a User sole
control over sensitive cryptographic material (e.g., private keys)
related to their PID and/or (Q)EAA, including in use cases for electronic
identification and creating a signature or seal.

EUDI Wallet Providers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
requirements for EUDI Wallets.

#### 4.1.3 Person Identification Data (PID) Providers

PID Providers are trusted entities responsible to:

* verify the identity of the EUDI Wallet User in compliance with LoA
  High requirements,
* issue PID to the EUDI Wallet in a harmonised common format and
* make available information[^10] for Relying Parties to verify the
  validity of the PID.

The terms and conditions of these services are for each Member State to
determine.

PID Providers MAY e.g., be the same organisations that today issue
official identity documents, electronic identity means, EUDI Wallet
Providers etc. EUDI Wallet Providers MAY be the same organisations as PID
Providers. In case an organisation acts as both a PID Provider and a
Wallet Provider, it SHALL comply with all requirements for both PID
Providers and Wallet Providers.

#### 4.1.4 Trusted List Providers

The specific status of a role in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem SHALL be
verified in a trustworthy manner. Such roles are:

- EUDI Wallet Providers
- Person Identification Data Providers
- Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA) providers
- Qualified certificate for electronic signature/seal (QC) providers
- Relying Parties
- Non-qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA) providers
- Non-qualified certificate for electronic signature/seal providers
- Providers of other Trust Services
- Catalogues of attributes and schemes for the attestations of attribute
  providers

Other roles may be necessary and thus need to be defined and explicitly
mentioned depending on the specific role and their criticality for
example the different roles and actors involved with remote signing
processes.

When used, Trusted List[^11] need to provide a registration service for
the relevant entities, maintain a registry and enable third party access
to the registry information. The terms and conditions of entities to
become registered are for each registrar to determine unless specified
in e.g., sectoral rules.

#### 4.1.5 Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers
Qualified EAA are provided by QTSPs. The general Trust Framework for
QTSPs apply also to QEAA, but specific rules for this Trust Service need
to be defined as well. QEAA Providers maintain an interface for
requesting and providing QEAAs, including a mutual authentication
interface with EUDI Wallets and potentially an interface towards
Authentic Sources to verify attributes. QEAA Providers provide
information or the location of the services that can be used to enquire
about the validity status of the QEAAs, without having an ability to
receive any information about the use of the attestations. The terms and
conditions of these services are for each QTSP to determine, beyond what
is specified in the eIDAS Regulation.

#### 4.1.6 Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers
Non-qualified EAA can be provided by any Trust Service Provider. While
they are supervised under eIDAS, it can be assumed that other legal or
contractual frameworks than eIDAS mostly govern the rules for provision,
use and recognition of EAA. Such other frameworks may cover policy areas
such as driving licences, educational credentials, digital payments,
although they may also rely on qualified Electronic Attestation of
Attributes Providers. For EAA to be used, TSPs offer Users a way to
request and obtain EAA, meaning they need to technically comply with EUDI
Wallet interface specifications. Depending on the domain rules, EAA
providers may provide validity information about EAA, without having an
ability to receive any information about the use of the EAA. The terms
and conditions of issuing EAAs and related services are subject to
sectoral rules.

#### 4.1.7 Qualified and Non-Qualified Certificates for Electronic Signature/Seal Providers

Article 6a(3) of COM(2021)281 final requires the EUDI Wallet to enable
the User to create qualified electronic signatures or seals. This goal
can be reached by several ways:

- The EUDI Wallet is certified as a qualified signature/seal creation
  device (QSCD), or

- It implements secure authentication and signature/seal invocation
  capabilities as a part of a local QSCD or a remote QSCD managed by a
  QTSP.

EUDI Wallet interfaces with QSCDs will be further expanded in future
versions of this document.

#### 4.1.8 Providers of other Trust Services

EUDI Wallet interaction with providers of other qualified or
non-qualified Trust Services such as timestamps may be further described
in future versions of the ARF.

#### 4.1.9 Authentic Sources
Authentic Sources are the public or private repositories or systems
recognised or required by law containing attributes about a natural or
legal persons. The Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI of the
legislative proposal are sources for, for instance, attributes on
address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality,
education and training qualifications titles and licences, professional
qualifications titles and licences, public permits and licences,
financial and company data. Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI are
required to provide interfaces to (Q)EAA Providers to verify the
authenticity of the above attributes, either directly or via designated
intermediaries recognised at national level. Authentic Sources MAY also
issue (Q)EAAs themselves if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS
Regulation. 

It is up to the Member States to define terms and conditions for the
provisioning of these attestations, but according to the minimum
technical specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the
verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of
attributes.


#### 4.1.10 Relying Parties

Relying Parties are natural or legal persons that rely upon an
electronic identification or a Trust Service. In the context of EUDI
Wallets, they request the necessary attributes contained within the PID
dataset, QEAA and EAA from EUDI Wallet Users to rely on the EUDI Wallet,
subject to the acceptance by the owner of the Wallet (User) and within
the limits of applicable legislation and rules. The reason for reliance
on the EUDI Wallet may be a legal requirement, a contractual agreement,
or their own decision. To rely on the EUDI Wallet, Relying Parties need
to inform the Member State where they are established and their
intention for doing so. Relying Parties need to maintain an interface
with the EUDI Wallet to request attestations with mutual authentication.
Relying Parties are responsible for authenticating PID and (Q)EAA.

#### 4.1.11 Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB)
The EUDI Wallets SHALL be certified by accredited public or private
bodies designated by Member States[^12]. QTSPs SHALL be audited regularly
by Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). CABs are accredited by a national
accreditation body according to Regulation 765/2008 as responsible for
carrying out assessments on which Member States will have to rely before
issuing a EUDI Wallet or providing the qualified status to a Trust
Service Provider. The standards and schemes used by CABs to fulfil their
tasks to certify EUDI Wallets are specified further in the Toolbox
process.

#### 4.1.12 Supervisory Bodies

The supervisory bodies are notified to the Commission by the Member
States, which supervise QTSPs and act, if necessary, in relation to
non-qualified Trust Service Providers.

#### 4.1.13 Device Manufacturers and Related Entities

EUDI Wallets will have several interfaces with the devices they are
based on, which may be for the following purposes:

- Local storage.
- Online Internet access.
- Sensors such as smartphone cameras, IR sensors, microphones, etc.
- Proximity communication channels such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
  Wi-Fi Aware, Near Field Communication (NFC).
- User interfaces such as screen, flashlights, speakers etc.
- Smart cards and secure elements for generating, storing and using
  private keys and other sensitive cryptographic material.


For secure cryptographic material storage, specific devices or services
may be interfaced with. Other related entities may be service providers
such as cloud service providers, app store providers etc.

The legal proposal sets constraints (e.g., compliance with LoA High) for
which kinds of devices and services may be used for the purpose of
issuing the EUDI Wallet. Likewise, the availability as well as terms and
conditions of device interface providers and related service providers
will set further constraints for EUDI Wallet Providers.

#### 4.1.14 Qualified and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Schema Providers

(Q)EAA Schema Providers publish schemas and vocabularies describing
(Q)EAA structure and semantics. It may enable other entities such as
Relying Parties to discover and validate (Q)EAA. The Commission sets out
the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures for this
purpose. Common schemas, including by sector- specific organisations are
critical for wide-spread adoption of (Q)EAAs.

#### 4.1.15 National Accreditation Bodies

National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) under Regulation (EC) No
765/2008[^13] are the bodies in Member States that perform
accreditation with authority derived from the Member State. NABs
accredit CABs as competent, independent, and supervised professional
certification bodies in charge of certifying products/services/processes
against normative document(s) establishing the requirements (e.g.,
legislations, specifications, protection profiles). NABs monitor the
CABs to which they have issued an accreditation certificate.

### 4.2 Lifecycle of an EUDI Wallet

The legal text defines the EUDI Wallet on a high level of abstraction, as
well as for the EUDI Wallet Providers that carry the legal obligation to
make sure that the Users can get a valid and fully functional EUDI
Wallet. The lifecycle of an EUDI Wallet will have some interactions with
the Trusted List Providers that specify the status of a role in the EUDI
Wallet ecosystem in a trustworthy manner. Developing an Architecture and
Reference Framework that SHALL provide guidance to the development of
such EUDI Wallet requires a more detailed level of abstraction to be
efficient and to yield a sufficiently expressive architecture description
to be prescriptive. 

This Chapter starts from a minimal object model and defines the
lifecycle of the core concepts: EUDI Wallet Solution, PID, (Q)EAA, and
EUDI Wallet Instance. These are chosen as a starting point because the
joint development of the ARF showed that the lifecycles of these
concepts are closely intertwined, which led to unclear description and
consequently misunderstandings.

*The object model will be extended as required in future versions of the
ARF.*

#### 4.2.1 Simplified EUDI Wallet Object Model

Figure 2 below distinguishes the concepts of EUDI Wallet Solution and
EUDI Wallet Instance. An EUDI Wallet Solution is the entire product
and/or service provided by a EUDI Wallet Provider. A EUDI Wallet
Instance is a personal instance of a EUDI Wallet Solution that belongs
to and is controlled by a User.

<!-- <img src="media/image2.png" style="width:2.70313in;height:2.37745in" /> -->

*Figure 2: Simplified EUDI Wallet Object Model*

This definition is not prescriptive of form factor, hence depending on
the implementation a EUDI Wallet Instance may consist of a single mobile
app, or a set of local and remote components available to a specific
User.

#### 4.2.2 PID and (Q)EAA Lifecycles

The lifecycles of PID and (Q)EAA are essentially identical, however, for
the scope of this description we refer subsequently only to PID. The
text of this section applied to PID applies mutatis mutandis to (Q)EAA.

PID in the context of the EUDI Wallet begins its lifecycle when being
issued to a EUDI Wallet Instance. Please note that this means that the
management of attributes in the Authentic Source (adhering to national
structures and attribute definitions) is outside of the scope of the
ARF.

Note that for certain use cases, the PID may be pre-provisioned, meaning
it is not yet valid when issued, but reaches its validity later. If PID
is issued on or after the validity start date, it is immediately
considered the state directly changes to valid. This means, however,
that PID could be "pre-issued".

![Figure 3: State-chart of PID](media/image3.png)
<!-- <img src="media/image3.png" style="width:2.26443in;height:2.54875in" /> -->

*Figure 3: State-chart of PID*

There are two possible transitions from a valid PID: it automatically
expires, by passage to the 'validity end date' or it is actively revoked
by its Provider. Expiration and revocation are essentially independent
transitions. Once PID is expired or revoked, it cannot transition back to
valid. If a change needs to be made to the PID (i.e., because of a User
name change), the PID Provider SHALL always issue a new PID.

#### 4.2.3 EUDI Wallet Solution Lifecycle

An EUDI Wallet Solution has a state of its own, as defined by Article
10a of the Regulation. The state of the Solution affects the state of
all EUDI Wallet Instances of that EUDI Wallet Solution. The
**Candidate** state is the first state of a EUDI Wallet Solution. This
means it is fully implemented and the EUDI Wallet Provider requests the
solution to be certified as EUDI Wallet.

If all the legal and technical criteria have been met, including the
certification of the Wallet Solution by CAB(s), then a Member State may
decide to start providing Instances of the Solution to Users. The state
of the Solution becomes "**valid"**. According to Article 6d, Member
State informs the Commission of each change in the certification status
of their EUDI Wallet Solutions. This means the EUDI Wallet Solution can
be officially launched, and Instances of the Solution can be provided to
Users.

![Figure 4: State-chart of Wallet Solution](media/image4.png)
<!-- <img src="media/image4.png" style="width:2.80793in;height:2.68666in" /> -->

*Figure 4: State-chart of Wallet Solution*

Under the legal conditions in Article 10a, paragraph 1, the issuing
Member State can temporarily suspend an EUDI Wallet Solution. This would
for example be the result of a critical security issue on that EUDI
Wallet Solution. This leads to the **suspended** state. Under Article
10a, paragraph 2, the issuing Member State can unsuspend the Wallet
Solution and continue issuance, bringing the Solution back to the
**valid** state. Under paragraph 3, the EUDI Wallet Solution can be
completely withdrawn.

#### 4.2.4 EUDI Wallet Instance Lifecycle

An EUDI Wallet Instance lifecycle begins when the User installs the
mobile app component of the EUDI Wallet solution provided by The EUDI
Wallet Provider.  Once an EUDI Wallet Instance is installed and
activated by the User and the EUDI Wallet Provider, it is in an
**operational** state. In this state, the User manages the EUDI Wallet
Instance, which may involve:

* The EUDI Wallet Provider updating the EUDI Wallet Instance,
* The EUDI Wallet Provider revoking the EUDI Wallet Instance, possibly at
  the User's request. Revocation of the Wallet Instance MAY be
  accomplished by revoking the Wallet Instance attestation (refer to
  section 6.3.4.2),
* The User uninstalling the EUDI Wallet Instance.

In the **operational** state of the EUDI Wallet Instance:

* The User can request an attestation, such as a PID or a (Q)EAA. The
  EUDI Wallet Instance may also fulfil non-EUDI specific functions, like
  storing loyalty cards, or any other type of certification that doesn't
  explicitly necessitate a link to a valid PID.
* Once an attestation is issued to the EUDI Wallet Instance, the User
  has the capability to release the attributes from this attestation to
  a Relying Party, based on their discretion.
* The PID/(Q)EAA Provider continues to be responsible for the management
  of the attestation, which may include re-issuing it. The PID/(Q)EAA
  Provider can also revoke the attestation, possibly at the User's
  request. The specific management options will be detailed in
  subsequent documents.

Once an EUDI Wallet Instance holds a **valid** PID set, it is
considered **valid**. If the PID expires or is revoked, the EUDI Wallet is
not automatically unusable, its state is merely downgraded back to
**operational**. This may affect the validity of a (Q)EAA or a certificate
for QES.

![Figure 5: State-chart of Wallet Instance](media/image5.png)
<!-- <img src="media/image5.png" style="width:2.08195in;height:2.53535in" /> -->
*Figure 5: State-chart of Wallet Instance*

Please note that this is independent from the possibility of a PID or
(Q)EAA Provider to revoke their attestations.


## 5	EUDI data model
The European Digital Identity Ecosystem data model manages the following
types of attestations:
* **Person Identification Data (PID)**: An attestation in electronic form
  that allows the authentication of attributes proofing the identity of a
  natural or legal person, or a natural person representing a legal
  person, or of an object. 
* **Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA)**: An attestation in
  electronic form that allows the authentication of attributes describing
  features, characteristics or qualities of a natural or legal person or
  of an entity, or a natural person representing a legal person, or of an
  object.
* **Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA)**: an
  electronic attestation of attributes (EAA), which is issued by a
  qualified trust service provide, and adhering to Annex V of the
  regulation. 

### 5.1	Person Identification Data
This section details the PID set as presented by the EUDI Wallet. Further
specifications regarding PID are detailed in the PID Rule Book, found in
Annex A.6.

A PID Provider May issue a PID set to the EUDI Wallet and enable the use
of the EUDI Wallet as an electronic identification means when accessing
online and offline services.

The mechanisms through which the PID is generated and provided to the
EUDI Wallet are up to the Member States and are only constrained by legal
requirements such as the requirements of LoA High, GDPR or any other
national or union law. 

In the following the data format as presented to the Relying Party will
be described, without any assumptions on how the EUDI Wallet retrieved or
generated this data beforehand.

#### 5.1.1 PID format and associated requirements 

##### 5.1.1.1	Principles for the PID set 
This Chapter proposes the definition of the PID set and discusses further
specification, data minimization and identifiers. The dataset proposed
herein is constructed based on the following principles:

* No two persons SHALL have the same PID set of values for mandatory
  attributes. 
* The PID set SHALL at least contain the minimum set of attributes
  aligned with eIDAS CIR 2015/1501[^14] as mandatory. 
* The mandatory data set is by nature limited to the (narrow)
  intersection of what all Member States can provide for all natural and
  legal persons and what is needed for electronic identification
  purposes. The mandatory data set will be complemented by optional
  attributes available only in some Member States to ensure it is usable
  for electronic identification purposes. 

##### 5.1.1.2	PID Attributes for Natural Persons
The below table provides an overview of mandatory and optional PID
attributes for natural persons. 

| Mandatory PID Attributes   | Optional PID Attributes   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| family_name                | family_name_birth         |
| given_name                 | given_name_birth          |
| birth_date                 | birth_place               | 
|                            | resident_address          |
|                            | gender                    |

|                            | age_over_NN               |
|                            | age_in_years              |
|                            | age_birth_year            |
|                            | birth_country             |
|                            | birth_state               |
|                            | birth_city                |
|                            | resident_address          |
|                            | resident_country          | 
|                            | resident_state            | 
|                            | resident_city             |
|                            | resident_postal_code      |

|                            | resident_house_number     | 
|                            | nationality               |

*Table 2 - Mandatory and optional PID attributes for natural persons*

Possible additional optional attributes have been added to facilitate a
wider range of authentication options both online and offline as well as
addressing learning from the current eIDAS implementations. Metadata
associated with a PID set is further detailed in Annex A.6.

#### 5.1.2	Issuing requirements for PID
The following table defines the requirements applicable to PID regarding
what information is included in the attestation, such as for purposes of
validity checks, authenticity, validation, policies, the data model, and
formats.

Future versions of this text may expand the table to specify
requirements. Note that these requirements are primarily aimed at the
first version of the EUDI Wallet Solution specifications, and that they
may change as the specifications evolve.

### 5.2	Qualified and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes

#### 5.2.1	Issuing requirements for (Q)EAA
The following table defines the requirements applicable to (Q)EAA-s
regarding what information is included in the attestation, such as for
purposes of validity checks, authenticity, validation, policies related
to key management, the data model, and formats.

(Q)EAA-s can be also issued under requirements applicable for PID.

Future versions of this text may expand the table to specify
requirements. Note that these requirements are primarily aimed at the
first version of the EUDI Wallet Solution specifications, and that they
may change as the specifications evolve.

Mobile Driving Licence attestations are further specified in mDL Rule
Book in Annex A.7.


| \#     | Requirement  |

*Table 4 - Issuing requirements for (Q)EAA*

### 5.3	Attestation rulebooks
Since version 1.2.0 of this document, the concept of an attestation
rulebook has been introduced. This is designed to compile a set of rules,
guidelines and standards governing the verification, management, and
usage of a specific attestation or group of attestations related to a use
case within the EUDI ecosystem. The primary goal of the rulebooks is to
ensure interoperability, security, privacy, and trust for EUDI Wallet's
attestations (PID and (Q)EAA).

Common compulsory specifications, rules, and guidelines are outlined in
the architecture and reference framework document, while those specific
to use cases are collated in the attestation's rulebooks. Two such
rulebooks, namely the PID and mDL rulebooks, have currently been included
as annexes to this document.

## 6 Trust Model

### 6.1 Overview and scope
The Trust Model describes, for all interactions in the lifecycle of a
EUDI Wallet Instance and an attestation, which trust relationships SHALL
exist between the interacting parties to enable these interactions.

Moreover, for the 'Attestation releasing' interaction in section 6.3.2,
this version of this document also describes, on a high level, how this
required trust can be established. This description includes references
to existing or draft standards that define detailed security measures.

The trust model is valid for both remote and proximity use cases.
However, technical measures taken to ensure that the requirements on
trust are fulfilled may differ between these two use cases. Moreover, the
authentication and authorization mechanisms will depend on the
characteristics of the interacting parties.


Please note:

* For interactions other than the 'Attestation releasing' interaction in
  section 6.3.2, the technical measures are not yet described, although
  section headings have been added already. 
* User privacy is not specifically discussed in this document.


#### 6.1.1	Authentication and authorization
Within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, many interactions take place between
parties in which one party requests another party to release data or
perform a task. For example, a User may ask a Provider to provide a PID
or (Q)EAA to a Wallet, or a Relying Party may ask a User to release a
specific attestation from its EUDI Wallet Instance. To be able to comply
with such requests, these parties SHALL trust each other. This trust
generally requires the existence of the following two conditions:

1. The requestee is sure about **the identity** of the requester, and
   optionally the requester is sure about the identity of the requestee.
   This is referred to as (single-side or mutual) *authentication*. 
2. The requestee is sure that the requester **has the right** to request
   the data or task requested. This is referred to as *authorization*.

#### 6.1.2	Assumptions on trust
This document makes the following assumptions regarding the need for
trust in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem:

* For any party in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, there is a risk that it
  could be impersonated by an attacker. Therefore, when any interaction
  between two parties takes place, both parties SHALL be able to
  authenticate the other. Note that this assumption does not mean that
  mutual authentication SHALL always take place; it just means that the
  possibility to do so SHALL exist and be available if one party has a
  business need to authenticate the other party it is interacting with.
  No authenticated party can be presumed trustworthy enough not to ask
  for attributes beyond their rights. 

#### 6.1.3	Other trust relations
Besides the trust relationships described in this Chapter, other trust
relations SHALL exist as well. For instance, Users, Providers and Relying
Parties SHALL implicitly trust certification bodies, trusted list
providers, vendors, OEMs, operating systems, and app stores. In many
contexts, this trust is primarily be rooted in authority and in
procedural measures, such as public oversight, published security and
operational policies, audits, etc., rather than in technical measures. To
verify that parties are indeed interacting with a trusted authority,
standard technical measures suitable for the context SHALL be used.

Moreover, besides the need for trust in the authenticity and
authorization of other parties in the ecosystem, parties SHALL also be
able to trust that the communication with such parties is confidential.
Measures to ensure this are not explicitly discussed in this document.

### 6.2	Trust throughout a EUDI Wallet Instance lifecycle

#### 6.2.1	Wallet Instance installation

##### 6.2.1.1	Required trust relationships
When a User decides to install an EUDI Wallet Instance on their device,
the following trust relationships SHALL exist:

1. The User SHALL be able to trust that the Wallet Solution (i.e., the
app or application the user is installing) is genuine, authentic and does
not contain any malware or other threats. 
2. The User SHALL be able to trust that the PID Provider will issue the
PID into an instance of a EUDI Wallet Solution. 
3. The User SHALL trust the EUDIW solution. This means that the User
trusts the App store  and the App publisher.

The next sections discuss these trust relationships.

##### 6.2.1.2	User's trust in the EUDI Wallet Solution
To be done.

##### 6.2.1.3	User's trust that the EUDI Wallet Solution is supporting the attestations
To be done.

#### 6.2.2	EUDI Wallet Instance activation

##### 6.2.2.1	Required trust relationships[^15]

After its' installation, a new EUDI Wallet Instance will need to be
activated by the Wallet Provider. Activation has at least the following
purposes:

* The EUDI Wallet Provider makes the EUDI Wallet Instance identifiable,
  by assigning an identifier to the Wallet Instance. This identifier is
  internal; its purpose is to allow the EUDI Wallet Provider to identify
  the EUDI Wallet Instance, for example when the User requests that the
  EUDI Wallet Instance SHALL be revoked.
* The EUDI Wallet Provider sets up a secure (authenticated) communication
  channel between the EUDI Wallet Instance and the EUDI Wallet Provider
  backend, for future use.
* The EUDI Wallet Provider requests data about the User's device from the
  EUDI Wallet Instance. This data may include the communication
  technologies supported by the device and the characteristics of the
  WSCD used by the device to securely store cryptographic keys and data
  associated with the EUDI Wallet Instance and the attestations.
* The EUDI Wallet Provider issues a EUDI Wallet Instance Attestation to
  the EUDI Wallet Instance. This attestation contains data about the EUDI
  Wallet Provider, the EUDI Wallet Solution, the EUDI Wallet Instance,
  the device and the WSCD. The EUDI Wallet Instance attestation has the
  same technical format and content as other attestations. This implies
  that the attestation will contain a Wallet Instance public key. The
  EUDI Wallet Instance key pair is generated by the EUDI Wallet Instance
  during activation, using the WSCD present in, or connected to, the
  User's device. The EUDI Wallet Instance attestation also contains
  information that allows a Provider or Relying Party to verify that the
  EUDI Wallet Provider did not revoke the EUDI Wallet Instance
  attestation, and hence the EUDI Wallet Instance itself.
* The EUDI Wallet Provider locally associates the EUDI Wallet Instance
  with a particular User, including on-device or backend-based User
  authentication methods that will be used by the EUDI Wallet Instance to
  authenticate the User towards the EUDI Wallet Provider only. The User
  details SHALL NOT be included in the EUDI Wallet Instance attestation.
* The EUDI Wallet Provider sets up a User account. This User account is
  needed if the User wants to interact with the EUDI Wallet Provider
  without using their EUDI Wallet Instance. An example of this is a
  request to revoke a EUDI Wallet Instance in case the User's device is
  lost or stolen. EUDI Wallet Providers MAY also offer other
  instance-related services through this User account. Please note the
  following:
  * In general, the EUDI Wallet Provider does not need to know the true
    identity of the User. An alias, for example an e-mail address, is
    sufficient. However, the EUDI Wallet Provider MAY request the true
    identity of the User to be able to offer additional services. It is
    up to the EUDI Wallet Provider to determine the conditions for
    creating an online account, and to the User to accept or refuse these
    conditions.
  * The information in the User account, especially the identifier(s) for
    the User, the User's device, and the EUDI Wallet Instance (if any),
    SHALL be stored and used only in the EUDI Wallet Provider back
    office. The EUDI Wallet Provider SHALL NOT put this information in
    the EUDI Wallet Instance attestation.

For successful EUDI Wallet Instance activation, the following trust
relations need to exist:

1. The EUDI Wallet Instance needs to be able to trust the EUDI Wallet
   Provider, meaning that the instance is sure that it is dealing with
   the genuine EUDI Wallet Provider.
2. The EUDI Wallet Provider needs to be able to trust the EUDI Wallet
   Instance. This means that the EUDI Wallet Provider is sure that the
   instance is indeed a true instance of their EUDI Wallet Solution, and
   not a fake app. 

The next sections discuss these trust relationships.

##### 6.2.2.2	EUDI Wallet Instance trusts Wallet Provider
To be done.

##### 6.2.2.3	EUDI Wallet Provider trusts Wallet Instance
To be done.

#### 6.2.3	EUDI Wallet Instance management

##### 6.2.3.1	Required trust relationships
Starting from EUDI Wallet Instance activation and throughout its
lifetime, a EUDI Wallet Instance SHALL be managed by the EUDI Wallet
Provider. Management actions could be initiated by the following
entities.

* **The EUDI Wallet Provider**. For example, to perform the installation
  of a new version of the Wallet Solution upon users request or
  approval. 
* **The User**. For example, to request the Wallet Provider to revoke
  the Wallet Instance in case of loss or theft.
* **The EUDI Wallet Instance**, potentially. For example, to request an
  update of the EUDI Wallet Instance Attestation, as defined in section
  6.2.2.

For this, the following trust relations need to exist:

1. The User needs to be able to trust the EUDI Wallet Provider. This
   means that the User is sure that he is dealing with the genuine EUDI
   Wallet Provider responsible for their EUDI Wallet Instance.
2. The EUDI Wallet Instance needs to be able to trust the EUDI Wallet
   Provider, meaning that the EUDI Wallet Instance is sure that it is
   dealing with the genuine EUDI Wallet Provider.
3. The EUDI Wallet Provider needs to be able to trust the EUDI Wallet
   Instance. This means that the EUDI Wallet Provider is sure that the
   EUDI Wallet Instance is indeed a true instance of their EUDI Wallet
   Solution, and not a fake app.
4. The EUDI Wallet Provider needs to be able to trust the User. This
   means that the EUDI Wallet Provider is sure that the User is indeed
   the User that was associated with the EUDI Wallet Instance during
   activation; see section 6.2.2.1.

The next sections discuss these trust relationships.

##### 6.2.3.2	EUDI Wallet Instance trust in the Wallet Provider
Section 6.2.2.2. describes how a EUDI Wallet Instance can trust a Wallet
Provider.

##### 6.2.3.3	EUDI Wallet provider trust in the EUDI Wallet Instance
Section 6.2.3.3. describes how a EUDI Wallet Provider can trust a Wallet
Instance.

##### 6.2.3.5	EUDI Wallet Provider trust in the User
To be done.

### 6.3	Trust throughout an attestation lifecycle

#### 6.3.1	Attestation issuance

##### 6.3.1.1	Required trust relationships
When a User requests a Provider to issue a PID or (Q)EAA to their EUDI
Wallet Instance, the following trust relationships SHALL exist:

1. The User SHALL be able to trust the Provider, meaning that the User is
   sure that the attestation they receive is issued by an authorized
   Provider. 
2. The Provider SHALL be able to trust the User, meaning that the
   Provider is sure about the identity of the User. This is necessary to
   be able to determine the value of the attributes that the Provider
   will attest to. For instance, a PID Provider SHALL ensure it provides
   the correct family name and date of birth to the Wallet Instance.
   Please note that the method by which the provider performs user
   identification and authentication is out of scope of this document. 
3. The Provider SHALL be able to trust the EUDI Wallet Provider. 
4. The Provider SHALL be able to trust the EUDI Wallet Instance. This
   means the Provider can verify that the app that it is interacting with
   is indeed an instance of the approved Wallet Solution of a trusted
   EUDI Wallet Provider. Moreover, If the Provider has specific
   functional requirements for EUDI Wallet Instances containing 'their'
   attestations, the Provider SHALL be able to trust that the User's EUDI
   Wallet Instance indeed supports all these features. 

The next sections discuss these trust relationships.

##### 6.3.1.2 User trust in the Provider
To be done.

##### 6.3.1.3	Provider trust in the User
To be done.

##### 6.3.1.4	Provider trust in the EUDI Wallet Instance
To be done.

#### 6.3.2	Attestation releasing

##### 6.3.2.1	Required trust relationships

When a Relying Party (RP) requests a User to release some attributes from his/her EUDI Wallet Instance, the following trust relationships mustSHALL exist:

1. The Relying Party SHALL be able to trust the attestation Provider.
2. The Relying Party SHALL be able to trust that the attestation released
   by the EUDI Wallet Instance is authentic, meaning that it originated
   from a trusted Provider and has not been changed.
3. The Relying Party SHALL be able to trust that the attestation Provider
   issued this attestation to the EUDI Wallet Instance that provided it
   to the Relying Party. In other words, the attestation was not copied
   and replayed. This is generally called device binding.
4. The Relying Party SHALL be able to trust the EUDI Wallet. 
5. The User SHALL be able to trust the Relying Party, meaning that the
   User is sure about the Relying Party's identity.
6. The User SHALL be able to trust that the Relying Party does not
   request more data than it reasonably needs for the use case.

The next sections discuss these trust relationships.

Please note the following assumptions, which are valid at least for the
current version of this document: 

* All attestations are assumed to be signed by the attestation Provider,
  rather than by the EUDI Wallet Instance (the latter are sometimes
  called self-signed attestations). The only attestations that will be
  trusted by Relying Parties are those that are signed by a trusted
  attestation Provider. The only potential exception may be a pseudonym
  for the User. If the value of a pseudonym attribute is assigned by the
  User or generated by the Wallet instance, it MAY be signed by the EUDI
  Wallet Instance rather than the Provider. If so, a Relying Party using
  such a pseudonym SHALL accept the associated risks or mitigate it in an
  out-of-band manner. These risks may include the possibility of fake
  pseudonyms, created by an attacker capable of lifting an attestation
  private key from a WSCD. 
* A Relying Party is assumed to trust the attestation Provider to have
  verified the technical properties of the EUDI Wallet Instance and the
  User's device and  WSCD (as documented in the Wallet Instance
  attestation) at the time it issued the attestation. Consequently, the
  Relying Party does not verify these technical properties during the
  attestation release process. To elaborate: A Relying Party typically has
  a list of attestations that it accepts for a certain use case. For
  example, a Relying Party MAY accept a mobile driving license as a proof
  of identity. If so, that Relying Party SHALL accept any valid and
  authentic mDL, regardless of the mobile device it is installed on. If the
  Relying Party were to make its own independent assessment of the security
  of the User's device, there is a possibility that an mDL will not be
  accepted, even though it is valid. That would be confusing to Users and
  might diminish their trust in the EUDI Wallet Instance as well as the
  attestation.
* An attestation is assumed to be bound to the EUDI Wallet Instance (and
  thus the device) to which the Provider issued it, and the Relying Party
  will verify that this is indeed the case. In other words, a Relying
  Party verifies device binding as described in section 6.3.2.4. This is
  a consequence of the fact that either ISO/IEC 18013-5 or OpenID4VP is
  mandatory for the EUDI Wallet Solutions that are in scope of the
  current version of this document.

##### 6.3.2.2	Relying Party trusts Provider
A Relying Party SHALL be able to verify that the Provider is trusted to
issue the type of attestation in question. For instance, a Provider may
be trusted to issue a diploma, but not a PID, or conversely. 

As part of this verification process, the Relying Party also obtains a
public key of the Provider, which functions as a trust anchor and allows
it to verify the attestation signatures created by the Provider. There
are at least two methods to communicate this public key, using
peer-to-peer communication, or using a trusted list. The public key
itself may be encapsulated, for instance in a X.509 certificate or in an
Entity Statement according to OpenID Federation.

Peer-to-peer communication of the Provider public key (trust anchor)
means that every Relying Party individually decides to trust each
Provider. The Relying Party then obtains the Provider's public key via a
manual or automated process agreed between the Provider and the Relying
Party, for instance by downloading it from the Provider's website. A
peer-to-peer process has the advantages of flexibility and low overhead.
However, it is hardly scalable and therefore not suitable for
attestations such as PIDs, mDLs, diplomas, or health insurance cards, for
which there many tens to hundreds of different providers in the EU and
thousands of Relying Parties, which moreover do not (necessarily) know
each other. Moreover, a peer-to-peer process assumes that each Relying
Party has sufficient technical knowledge and budget to judge the level of
security of each Provider's systems and processes for, among others,
private key management. This is not realistic for high-value
attestations. A peer-to-peer process may therefore be suitable for
low-value attestations in contexts where Providers and Relying Parties
know each other, for example membership cards or vouchers.

For more valuable attestations, or for attestations for which Providers
and Relying Parties do not know each other, a trusted list of Providers
is a better solution. This trusted list is provided by a trusted list
provider, which is a central party responsible for (and capable of)
verifying that the level of security of an Providers' systems and
processes is sufficient for the type of attestation it issues, and
comparable to the level of security of other Providers for the same type
of attestation. This may include requiring that a Provider documents
these systems and processes, for example in a certificate policy
complying with EN 319 411, and is audited regularly for compliance to
that policy. The trusted list provider also validates that each Provider
is (legally) allowed to issue the type(s) of attestation it wants to
issue. The trusted list provider documents that in its trusted list,
together with the public key (trust anchor) of each trusted Provider. The
list is signed by the trusted list provider and can be downloaded and
processed by a Relying Party in an automated fashion.

Please note the following: 

* A trusted list provider may become a single point of failure. A
  successful attack may mean that untrusted Providers are put on the
  trusted list. It is therefore essential that the systems and processes
  used by a trusted list provider are secure.
* There can be multiple trusted list providers. It is conceivable that
  there will be trusted list providers on the EU level and for individual
  member states, as well as trusted list providers per sector, for
  example education or health care. 
* It is not mandatory for each Relying Party to possess the root
  certificates of all Providers. Relying Parties will choose which
  trusted list providers they need to subscribe to, depending on the
  Member States and industries they are operating in.

Finally, note that freedom of contract applies to all Relying Parties.
This means that a Relying Party can determine itself which Providers they
want to recognize, except if there is a legal requirement that the
attestations of certain Providers SHALL be accepted. That is generally
the case for PID Providers and QEAA Providers. However, this does not
mean that the above process is not necessary for these providers. 


##### 6.3.2.3 Relying Party trusts the authenticity of the attestation
The following steps are essential for ensuring that the Relying Party
can trust the attestation:

1. The Relying Party verifies the seal or signature over the attestation. 
2. The Relying Party verifies that the public key it used for verifying
   the seal or signature can be trusted, either because the Relying Party
   obtained the key in a manner described in section 6.3.2.2, or because
   is protected by means of a chain of trust that ends in a trusted
   Provider public key that was obtained in such a manner.  
3. The Relying Party validates that the Provider has not revoked the
   attestation. 

If and only if all these verifications succeed, the Relying Party can
trust the authenticity of the attestation.

Regarding the technical implementation of these steps: 

* For proximity flows, requirements 6 and 7 in section 5.1.2 require support for \[ISO18013-5\]. This standard describes a mechanism for this authentication, called Provider data authentication.
  * For step 1 above, this mechanism uses a cryptographically signed data construct called a Mobile Security Object (MSO). The seal or signature over the MSO is created by a Document Signer, which is a function of the Provider. The Document Signer certificate is signed by the Provider's certificate.
  * For step 2 above, ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies a Public Key Infrastructure, including certificate formats and a format for implementing a trust list. 
  * The mechanism for step 3 is described in section 6.3.4.
* For remote flows,  requirements 6 and 7 in section 5.1.2 require support for \[SD-JWT\].
  * For step 1 above, \[SD-JWT\] provides a similar trust mechanism as the MSO mechanism in ISO/IEC 18013-5.
  * The mechanism for step 3 is described in section 6.3.4. 

##### 6.3.2.4 Relying Party trusts device binding
The Relying Party SHALL be able to trust that an attestation it receives was not copied and replayed. In other words, the Relying Party trusts that the attestation is bound to the same device to which the Provider issued it [^16].

The Relying Party can trust that this is the case if the EUDI Wallet Instance signs some contextual information with the private key of the attestation. This information SHALL include a random number generated by the Relying Party. To verify this signature, the Relying Party needs to receive the public key of the attestation, which SHALL be signed (directly or indirectly) by the Provider of the attestation. By signing the public key, the Provider certifies that the public key indeed belongs to the attestation. The Relying Party SHALL additionally verify that the Wallet Instance is in possession of the corresponding private key; the Relying Party does so by verifying the signature over the random number generated by the Relying Party. 

Note that a EUDI Wallet Instance can contain multiple attestations, originating from multiple Providers. For each attestation, the EUDI Wallet Instance has access to an attestation private key, which is stored in the WSCD in (or connected to) the User's device. As discussed in section 6.2.2, the EUDI Wallet Instance also contains a EUDI Wallet Instance private key. Depending on the attestation requested by the 6.3.2.4, the EUDI Wallet Instance SHALL use the correct private key for signing the random number generated by the Relying Party. 

\[ISO/IEC 18013-5\] specifies a mechanism for this, called mdoc authentication. The EUDI Wallet Instance signs contextual information (called the SessionTranscript), which includes a nonce from the Relying Party, namely its ephemeral public key for session encryption. The standard specifies which algorithms can be used for signing and how the attestation public key is incorporated in the MSO.

\[SD-JWT\] similarly specifies how an attestation public key can be incorporated in the JWT. 

To trust these mechanisms, the Relying Party SHALL trust that the security of the attestation private key has not been compromised. This private key is stored in a WSCD, or connected to, the device on which the EUDI Wallet Instance is installed. As discussed in section 6.3.2.1, the Relying Party does not need to perform an independent evaluation of the security of the WSCD, because it trusts the Provider to have done this. However, the Relying Party SHALL verify that the Provider did not revoke the attestation.

##### 6.3.2.5 Relying Party trusts User binding
A Relying Party SHALL be able to trust the EUDI Wallet. 

Note: Use cases involving legal representation and similar situations,
which imply that the person presenting is different from the User, but
the same as the person having the legal representation rights, are out of
scope of the current version of the Trust Model and will be explored in
future versions of this document. 

The mechanism(s) for User binding depend on the type of use case:

* For supervised proximity flows, a human is present during the
  transaction, on behalf of the Relying Party. If User binding is
  required in such cases, the Relying Party can request the User
  portrait, next to other attributes, and the EUDI Wallet Instance can
  release it. The portrait SHALL be signed by a trusted Provider [^17].
  The human supervisor then visually compares this portrait to the face
  of the person presenting the attestation. However, please note that the
  presence and use of the User portrait in the PID will be further
  detailed in a future version of this document.
* For some unsupervised proximity flows, the User portrait may similarly
  be released and be used for face recognition by a machine. This may
  happen for example in automatic border control systems. However, to
  generate trustworthy outcomes this process requires special conditions,
  such as good lighting and clear instructions for the User for
  positioning their face.
* For other unsupervised use cases and for remote use cases, using the
  User portrait for user authentication by the Relying Party is generally
  considered to be impractical. Relying Parties SHALL therefore trust
  User authentication mechanisms present on or connected to the device
  which the EUDI Wallet Instance is installed on [^18].  


##### 6.3.2.6 User trusts the identity of the Relying Party
To ensure that the User knows and trusts the identity of the Relying
Party, a mechanism for Relying Party authentication mustSHALL be
implemented. In essence, such a mechanism works as follows:

1. The Relying Party creates a signature over the request using a Relying
   Party private key. The Relying Party includes the associated Relying
   Party certificate in the request. This certificate is signed by a
   certificate authority (CA) trusted by the Wallet Instance for this
   purpose. This step will include mechanisms that will prevent replay
   attacks and possible other attacks.
2. The Wallet Instance verifies the signature over the request, and
   verifies that the Relying Party certificate is indeed issued by the
   trusted CA.
3. The Wallet Instance validates that the trusted CA has not revoked the
   Relying Party certificate.

##### 6.3.2.7 User trusts that the Relying Party does not over-ask
How this trust relationship is established is described in section 7.6 on Relying Party authorization.

#### 6.3.3 Attestation management
Throughout its lifetime, an attestation needs to be managed by the
Provider. This means that for the purposes of this Trust Model,
attestation management has similarities to the part of EUDI Wallet
Instance management that involves the EUDI Wallet Provider as the
Provider of a EUDI Wallet Instance attestation, which was already
discussed in section 6.2.3.

#### 6.3.4 Attestation revocation
Attestation revocation is a process whereby the Provider of an
attestation declares that Relying Parties SHOULD no longer trust a
particular attestation, even though the attestation is still valid
temporally and contains a valid Provider signature. As described in
section 6.3.2.3, during the process of releasing an
attestation, a Relying Party SHOULD verify that the Provider has not
revoked the attestation. Revocation checking is a process that takes
place after the Relying Party has validated that the validity period of
the attestation has not expired and the signature over the attestation is
correct.

The Relying Party uses a Relying Party Instance to interact with the
User's Wallet Instance. This includes carrying out attestation revocation
checking.

When discussing attestation revocation, it is essential to realize that
in many cases there is a difference between an attestation and the
document it represents, for instance a driving license, passport,
recurring medicine prescription, health insurance card, vehicle
registration card, etc. Such a document typically has an administrative
validity period of multiple years. A diploma typically even has no end of
validity at all. In contrast, an attestation is a digital representation
of such a document and has a cryptographic proof of its authenticity with
a validity period that is typically short, for example - several weeks. 

This implies that an attestation Provider will renew the attestation
regularly during the validity period of the document[^19]. Also, an
attestation Provider MAY issue multiple attestations that are
simultaneously valid but represent the same document. For example, a User
MAY have a mobile passport on their private phone and their work phone.
The attestations representing the passport on both phones will be
different, even though they contain the same attributes. The difference
is in the MSO (for ISO-compliant attestation) or SD-JWT + JWS (for SD-JWT
compliant attestation).
 
In some cases, this difference is relevant for revocation. For example,
if the above User loses their personal phone, the Provider will probably
revoke the mobile passport on that phone. But the attestations on the
work phone will remain valid, and the User will continue to be able to
use their passport on that phone. On the other hand, if the passport
itself is revoked, then all attestations representing their passport,
across both devices, will be revoked.

##### 6.3.4.1 Use cases for revocation of an attestation
Within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, an attestation SHALL be revoked if one
of the following conditions occur:

* The value of some attributes in the attestation has changed, and the
  attestation can be valid still for some time. In such cases, the
  Provider can issue a new attestation to the Wallet Instance, containing
  the new, correct value for the changed attribute. However, the Provider
  also needs to ensure that Relying Parties can no longer accept the
  existing attestation. For example, 
  * A PID contains the `age_over_18 attribute`, and the User has their
    18th birthday. The value of the attribute needs to change from False
    to True.
  * A User loses an existing driving category. A category needs to be
    removed.
* The attestation was wrongly issued.
* The attestation Provider suspects or knows the User has committed fraud
  or other relevant crime.
* The User notified the attestation Provider.
* In case of any (suspected) breach of security.

The attestation Provider SHALL analyze whether revocation is required in
these circumstances. Also, the Provider SHALL analyze if there are more
situations in which attestation revocation is required. 

A PID Provider or a (Q)EAA Provider MAY outsource the responsibility of
operating the revocation solution to a third party. However, the Provider
SHALL always remain responsible for triggering the revocation process for
an attestation if needed, and for the correctness of the revocation
information.

The only party in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem capable of revoking an
attestation SHALL be the attestation Provider. This is important, because
in some use cases, there are third parties that have the (legal) right to
invalidate an attestation. For example, in many jurisdictions the police
are allowed to confiscate a driving license if the User is caught is a
serious traffic violation. Another example is an electronic prescription
for medicines that is valid only once and must not be usable anymore
after the User has received the medicines[^20] . A third example is when
the attestation Provider and the Authentic Source for that attestation
are different parties. If so, the Authentic Source contains the
authoritative information about whether an attribute value must be
changed, and an attestation revoked or reissued. It must be the
responsibility of attestation Providers to regularly query the authentic
source for changes and reissue or revoke the relevant attestations
accordingly.

However, third parties that want to invalidate an attestation SHALL use
an out-of-band mechanism to notify the Providers about the attestation
that must be revoked. It is then up to the Provider to revoke the
attestation.

Comment: In case an attestation Provider is hacked, lost or ceases to
operate permanently for any reason, regular procedures SHALL be initiated
according to the situation. Instead of revoking each attestation that was
issued by that attestation Provider, the Provider itself  SHALL be
revoked and taken out from the relevant Trusted List, for example, so
that each time that attestation will be verified, it will fail because
the Providers' anchor of trust was not found in the Trusted List.   

##### 6.3.4.2 Use cases for revocation of a Wallet Instance
This document assumes that in some circumstances, a Wallet Provider
(perhaps on the initiative of a Member State) will need to revoke a
Wallet Instance. For example:

* if a major security incident has been found in the Wallet Solution. In
  this case, all instances of that Wallet Solution might be revoked (or
  suspended, see section 6.3.4.3).
* if a major security Incident has been found in the mobile device on
  which the Wallet Instance runs, or in the WSCD it uses. 
* if a particular Wallet Instance has been the subject of an attack.
* if the User notified the Wallet Provider that their device is lost or
  stolen. 

As can be seen from these examples, Wallet Instance revocation is more
complicated than attestation revocation, as a Wallet Instance consists of
multiple components that each may fail for different reasons. This
document does not specify a mechanism to be used by a Wallet Provider to
revoke a Wallet Instance, and by a Relying Party to verify if a Wallet
Instance has been revoked. Such a mechanism will be specified in a future
Epic.

##### 6.3.4.3 Use cases for suspension
In addition to revocation, there is the concept of suspension of an attestation. The main difference between these concepts is that suspension is reversible, whereas revocation SHALL be irreversible. However, suspension is inherently more complex to manage than revocation. Moreover, in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, in which issuance of a new attestation to replace a revoked one is typically easy, the advantages of a suspension mechanism are limited. Therefore, a Provider SHOULD NOT suspend any attestation. No mechanisms for suspension of attributes are foreseen in this document.

A (possible) exception to this rule is that Wallet Providers MAY be able to suspend a Wallet Instance in case the corresponding Wallet Solution is suspended. As described in section 4.2.3, this MAY be a legal requirement. This will be discussed in a future Epic. 

Unless indicated otherwise, all requirements and other statements in this document for a revocation mechanism are applicable for a suspension mechanism as well. 

##### 6.3.4.4 Revocation checking in wallet-to-wallet use cases
To be done.

##### 6.3.4.5 Cross-border and cross-sector use cases
To be done.

##### 6.3.4.6 Revocation chaining
To be done.

##### 6.3.4.7 Requirements for attestation revocation mechanisms
A mechanism for attestation revocation and revocation checking SHALL comply with the following requirements:

1. The revocation mechanism SHALL be easy to implement and be integrated
   with Wallet Instances based on ISO/IEC 18013-5 and \[SD-JWT\].
2. The revocation mechanism SHALL be independent of the Wallet Instance,
   meaning that even if the Wallet Instance is not trustworthy anymore,
   the Relying Party Instance can still verify, in a trustworthy manner,
   whether the attestation has been revoked. This implies that the
   Relying Party SHALL be able to obtain revocation status information
   independently from the Wallet Instance.
3. The revocation mechanism SHALL be privacy-preserving, to the maximum
   extent feasible given operational constraints. 
   1. The Provider SHALL NOT be able to learn anything about the User's
     use of an attestation based upon interactions between Relying
     Parties and the Provider related to attestation revocation checking. 
   2. Any attestation identifiers and other values used for enabling
     revocation checking SHALL NOT allow Relying Parties to correlate
     (and thus track) the User, even if they collude with other Relying
     Parties. 
4. The revocation mechanism SHALL be efficient, meaning that it SHALL
   require minimal resources from both the Provider and the Relying
   Parties in terms of bandwidth and storage.
5. The revocation mechanism SHALL be timely, meaning that revocation
   updates SHALL be fresh enough to satisfy the needs of Relying Parties
   that need to trust the attestation.
6. The revocation mechanism SHALL support use cases in which the Relying
   Party Instance is offline.
7. If required by national legislation, the revocation mechanism SHALL
   allow a Relying Party to prove afterwards that an attestation was not
   revoked at the time of verification, for example in case of a dispute
   between the Relying Party and the User.
8. The revocation mechanism SHOULD be mature, meaning that many different
   parties have experience with implementing and operating the mechanism.


##### 6.3.4.8 Possible revocation mechanisms
The concept of an attestation, is in many ways similar to digital
certificates in Public Key Infrastructures (PKI). The experience of
revoking such certificates can therefore be drawn upon. Two main
revocation mechanisms are generally supported in a PKI:

* In the first place, the Provider of the digital certificate can create
  a list of revoked certificates, sign it, and make it available to all
  interested Relying Parties. When a Relying Party needs to use a
  certificate, it SHALL verify that the identifier of this certificate is
  not included in the list of revoked certificates. Such a list is known
  as a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). In the context of the EUDI
  Wallet ecosystem, we will refer to it as an Attestation Revocation List
  (ARL).
* Secondly, the Provider of the digital certificate can set up a service
  that may be interrogated by a Relying Party in real time when the
  Relying Party needs to use a certificate. The Relying Party provides an
  identifier of the certificate, and the Provider responds with the
  corresponding current status, e.g., 'valid' or 'revoked'. A variation
  of this mechanism is possible, where it's not the Relying Party, but
  rather the subject of the certificate that requests the current
  revocation status of the certificate from the Provider service. The
  certificate subject then sends the response to the Relying Party
  together with the certificate itself. This mechanism is known as the
  Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), and the variation is known
  as 'OCSP stapling'. The server from which a Relying Party can get
  information regarding the revocation status of an attestation is the
  OCSP Responder. In the context of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, we will
  refer to it as an Online Attestation Status Protocol (OASP), OASP
  stapling and an OASP Responder.

Apart from these two mechanisms, Attestation Status Lists (ASL) are often
mentioned as a third possible revocation mechanism. The basic idea of an
Attestation Status List is that an attestation Provider, or a trusted
party acting on its behalf, publishes revocation status information for
all of its valid attestations in the form of a bitstring or byte array.
Each attestation is associated with a specific position in the
Attestation Status List. If the binary value of the position in the list
is 1, the associated attestation has status Revoked. If it is 0, it is
Valid. To verify whether a specific attestation has been revoked, a
Relying Party needs to retrieve the Attestation Status List. Therefore,
each attestation contains the URL where the ASL is located. The
attestation also contains an index, which is the position of the bit
associated with the attestation within the Attestation Status List. The
Relying Party then verifies if the value of the bit at the index position
is equal to 0 (Valid) or 1 (Revoked).

Other approaches to revocation exist. However, these have not been
implemented widely compared to the CRL and OCSP mechanisms described
above, and sometimes require comparatively more advanced cryptography. 

##### 6.3.4.9 Requirements for support of attestation revocation mechanisms
Relying Party Instances and Relying Parties SHALL support the Attestation
Status List mechanism and the Attestation Revocation List mechanism
specified in section 6.3.4.8. Relying Party Instances and Relying Parties
MAY additionally support the Online Attestation Status Protocol specified
in section 6.3.4.8.

Wallet Instances SHALL support the Attestation Status List mechanism
specified below and the Attestation Revocation List mechanism specified
in section 6.3.4.8. Wallet Instances MAY additionally support the Online
Attestation Status Protocol specified in section 6.3.4.8.

Wallet Instances and Relying Party instances MAY additionally support
OASP stapling. However, the current version of this document does not
contain a full specification of this mechanism.

Attestation Providers SHALL support one of the following methods for
attestation revocation:

1. Use short-lived attestations only, such that attestation revocation
   will never be necessary since the revocation process will take longer
   than the validity period of the attestation. In this case, the
   Provider does not need to support any of the revocation methods
   specified in this Chapter and attestations do not need to contain any
   information enabling the Relying Party to do a revocation check.
   According to requirement REV-6.2.4-03A in ETSI EN 319 411-1 (Trust
   Service Providers issuing certificates; Part 1: General requirements),
   the revocation process must take at most 24 hours. Therefore,
   Providers SHALL NOT use this method for attestations having a validity
   period of more than 24 hours except for non-qualified attestations.
2. The Attestation Status List mechanism specified in section 6.3.4.8. In
   this case, depending on whether the attestations are ISO-compliant or
   SD-JWT-compliant, the Provider SHALL extend the MSO of its
   attestations, or the Provider SHALL extend the SD-JWT of its
   attestations.
3. Regarding the Attestation Revocation List mechanism, depending on
   whether the attestations are ISO-compliant or SD-JWT-compliant, the
   Provider SHALL extend the MSO of its attestations, or the Provider
   SHALL extend the SD-JWT of its attestations.

Providers MAY additionally support the Online Attestation Status
Protocol. In this case, depending on whether the attestations are
ISO-compliant or SD-JWT-compliant, the Provider SHALL extend the MSO of
its attestations or the Provider SHALL extend the SD-JWT of its
attestations.

##### 6.3.4.10 Specification of revocation mechanisms in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem
To be done.

##### 6.3.4.11 Revocation validation by a Relying Party Instance
After obtaining an attestation from a Wallet Instance, a Relying Party
Instance SHALL verify the revocation status of the attestation. To do so,
the Relying Party Instance SHALL perform the following steps:

1. The Relying Party Instance SHALL inspect the MSO or SD-JWT of the
   attestation to see if it contains any revocation information. If not,
   the Relying Party Instance SHALL verify that the validity period of
   the attestation is equal to or less than 24 hours. If this is not the
   case, the Relying Party SHALL conclude that no reliable information
   regarding the revocation status of the attestation could be obtained.
2. The Relying Party Instance SHALL inspect the MSO or SD-JWT of the
   attestation to see if it contains Attestation Status List information.
   If so, the Relying Party Instance SHALL use the inspection procedure
   specified in \[JWTStatusList\][^21]  to find out the current status of
   the attestation.
3. The Relying Party Instance SHALL inspect the MSO or SD-JWT of the
   attestation to see if it contains Attestation Revocation List
   information. If so, the Relying Party Instance SHALL use the CRL
   Validation process described in Section 6.3 of \[RFC 5280\] to verify
   whether the attestation is revoked.
4. The Relying Party Instance SHALL inspect the response from the Wallet
   Instance to see if it contains an OASP response for the attestation
   (i.e., the attestation supports OASP stapling). If so, and if the
   Relying Party Instance supports OASP stapling, it SHALL inspect the
   OASP response as described in \[RFC 6960\] to find out the current
   status of the attestation.
5. The Relying Party Instance SHALL inspect the MSO or SD-JWT of the
   attestation to see if it contains Online Attestation Status Protocol
   information. If so, and if the Relying Party Instance supports OASP,
   the Relying Party Instance SHALL send an OASP request 1.1.1.1to the
   OASP Responder. The Relying Party Instance SHALL verify the signature
   over the OASP response and SHALL inspect the OASP response as
   described in \[RFC 6960\] to find out the current status of the
   attestation.

If none of these methods result in reliable information regarding the
revocation status of the attestation, it is up to the Relying Party to
take a decision on acceptance or refusal of the attestation. A Relying
Party SHALL perform a risk analysis to support this decision and SHALL
consider all relevant factors for the use case.

## 7 Specifications for Wallet Solutions
The reference architecture represents a set of choices made during the
architecture design process for EUDI Wallet Solutions. These choices were
informed by the need for EUDI Wallet Solutions to support various
scenarios where either the User or the Relying Party, or both, are
offline while providing flexibility for Member States to implement an
EUDI Wallet Solution in various configurations of components

### 7.1 Design considerations
To limit complexity, the initial EUDI Wallet Solution specifications will
include only a minimum number of solution components that enable the use
of the EUDI Wallet Instance for identification of the User, so that it
can function as an eID means. 

The choices herein are neither a reflection of relative importance nor a
long-term commitment. Instead, the selection was guided by factors such
as the availability and maturity of standards and specifications, an
estimation of ease of adoption, and how much flexibility (in terms of use
cases enabled) is afforded by each solution component. 

The solution components proposed herein evidence the current expectation
of using the ISO/IEC 23220 standard series, once publicly available, for
future ARF versions.

### 7.2 Architecture components
The following components have been identified as the building blocks of
the EUDI Wallet architecture needed to implement an EUDI Wallet
Solution:

- **Cryptographic keys management system.** This component is
  responsible to manage and store cryptographic information like the
  private keys generated for instance during the PID issuance process.

- **Attestation exchange Protocol**. This protocol defines how to
  request and present the PID and the (Q)EAA in a secure and privacy
  preserving fashion. The protocol also defines how authentication is
  performed between the Relying Party and the EUDI Wallet Instance, in
  particular the mechanism through which the Relying Party can request
  identification through the EUDI Wallet. The request contains all the
  required information about the Relying Party and the requested data.
  Trust negotiation and mutual authentication are addressed by this
  protocol.

- **Issuance Protocol**. The protocol defines how PID and (Q)EAA SHOULD
  be issued and in which formats.

- **Data model**. The data model defines and describes the data elements
  and how they interact with each other and their properties.

- **PID and (Q)EAA schemas**. The attestation schema contains the
  structure and the logical organisation of the data that define the
  properties of the attestation, the attributes of the User. The
  attestation schema also contains additional information including, but
  not limited to, the verification mechanisms, the underlying identity
  assurance, and Trust Framework to which the properties are related,
  and the proof of possession by the legitimate User.

- **PID and (Q)EAA formats**. PID and (Q)EAA formats are used to
  represent the characteristic, quality, right or permission of a
  natural or legal person or of an object, in the form of signed and
  verifiable digital artifacts, containing any additional properties for
  interoperability purposes.

- **Signature formats**. Technical implementation of one or more
  mathematical methods in the form of a digital artifact, aimed at
  demonstrating the authenticity of a digital document, its integrity,
  authenticating the author of a document and optionally also its
  recipient (audience of the document).

- **Trust Model.** Collection of rules that ensure the legitimacy of the
  components and the entities involved in the EUDI Wallet
  infrastructure, covering:
  - User authentication.
  - Providers identification.
  - Providers registration.
  - Recognised data models and schemas.
  - Relying Parties' registration and authentication.
  - Mechanisms to establish the trust in a cross-domain scenario.


> Trust Model components enable the identification of the entities that
> rely on the EUDI Wallet and are instrumental for the authenticity,
> confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of the information.
> Different Trust Models are available based on different rules.
>
> Trusted List is a mechanism under a Trust Model to publish and obtain
> information about authoritative parties, e.g., Providers of PID, (Q)EAA
> and Relying Parties.

- **Cryptographic suites and mechanisms**. Algorithms and methods that
  secure the data exchange in terms of confidentiality and integrity.

- **Entity identifiers**. Unique identifiers for all the elements of the
  data model.

- **Validity status check**. Mechanism to publish and obtain information
  about validity status of, inter alia, PID, (Q)EAA, certificate, etc.

### 7.3 Logical architecture

Where an EUDI Wallet Solution has an application running on a mobile
device, there may be a need for additional trusted components which are
not part of that application but are nevertheless logically part of the
EUDI Wallet. Such a need may arise for various reasons:

- Security: e.g., if a particular device does not have sufficiently
  secure hardware like a secure element, external hardware components
  like smartcards may be needed .
- Re-use of backend systems.
- Re-use of decentralised identity infrastructure.

These trusted components may be: external trusted storage, external or
embedded trusted hardware or other remote EUDI Wallets components. Below
is a conceptual representation of variations in implementing the EUDI
Wallet components:

### 7.4 Types of flows

This section describes the four types of flows that the EUDI Wallet SHALL
support on a general level. The four flows are as follows:

1. Proximity supervised flow.
2. Proximity unsupervised flow.
3. Remote cross-device flow.
4. Remote same-device flow.

Flows 1 and 2 are related to a scenario where the EUDI Wallet User is
physically close to a Relying Party and the attestation exchange and
disclosure (PID and/or QEAA) happens using proximity protocols (NFC,
Bluetooth, QR-Code, etc.), without the User having internet connectivity
(note that this does not imply that any other function aside from
transport is possible offline). The two proximity flows differ in one
important way. In the supervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents
verifiable attributes to, or under supervision of, a human acting as a
Relying Party (who may operate a device of their own). In the
unsupervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents verifiable attributes to a
machine without human supervision.

Flows 3 and 4 are related to a scenario where data exchange happens over
the Internet. The two remote flows differ in one important way. In the
remote cross-device flow, the EUDI Wallet User consumes information from
the service on another device than the EUDI Wallet device, which is only
used to secure the session (for instance using the EUDI Wallet to scan a
QR code on a login page to access a bank account on their web browser).
In contrast, in the remote same-device flow, the EUDI Wallet User uses
the EUDI Wallet device both for securing the session and to consume the
information from the service.

The User journeys will rely on at least one, and likely a combination,
of the above described four flows. Note that the four flows can be
implemented in multiple ways. The specific implementations are outside
the scope of this text.

Further consideration is particularly warranted with regards to the two
proximity flows as these are possible with or without internet
connectivity. Possible scenarios include:

- the User and Relying Party are both online,
- only the User is online,
- only the Relying Party is online,
- The User and the Relying Party are both offline.

For all the flows described above and specifically for the proximity
unsupervised flow the User authorization is a prerequisite for data
exchange.

The initial PID and EAA configurations are detailed next (configurations
may be added as required in the future).

### 7.5 Relying Party authentication

#### 7.5.1 High-Level requirements
To perform Relying Party authentication, the Wallet Instance needs to
check and validate the module entity with which it communicates, which is
called a "Relying Party Instance". There could be multiple Relying Party
Instances for each Relying Party. Let's take for example a Relying Party
called the "Traffic Police", which is represented by numerous policemen
stationed along the highways and in the cities, each policeman carrying a
hand-held Relying Party device and a suitable application, that has the
capability to authenticate the Traffic Police to a User holding a Wallet
Instance and an mDL stored inside it. The concept of a Relying Party
Instance is readily understood in this proximity scenario.

The same could be visualized for the remote scenarios. Let's take for
example the Tax Authority as a Relying Party that wants to communicate
with Wallet Instances. To do so, the Tax Authority needs a software
module that is capable of sending ISO-compliant or SD-JWT-compliant
requests to Wallet Instances, and to receive (and possibly process) the
responses. The Tax Authority can have one Relying Party Instance for all
of its activities, or alternatively, it can decide to have several
Relying Party Instances, for separate operational purposes. For example,
it could have separate Relying Party Instances for different geographical
regions, or one Relying Party Instance for natural persons' Wallet
Instances and a separate Relying Party Instance for legal persons' Wallet
Instances. In each use case, a User will authenticate the relevant
Relying Party Instance that has contacted him during the session.

When a Relying Party requests a User to release some attributes from
their Wallet Instance, the User SHALL be able to trust that they are
dealing with an identified and authenticated Relying Party. Additionally,
the User SHALL be able to trust that the request from the Relying party
was not copied and replayed. 

To allow this, the following is required:

* The Wallet Instance used by a User, as well as the Relying Party
  Instance used by the Relying Party, SHALL implement a mechanism for
  Relying Party authentication. 
* A Wallet Instance and a Relying Party Instance SHALL perform Relying
  Party authentication in all use cases, whether proximity or remote. 

Note: This requirement was discussed and there were different opinions
about the need to authenticate the Relying Party in each of the scenarios
â€“ proximity or remote. The goal of this requirement is to secure the
users of the EUDI wallets in any transaction they are involved in, from
any risk of false authentication - without exceptions. 

Note: This recommendation stems from realizing that strict requirements
to use HSMs for all relying parties will not be practical to enforce and
will limit the usage of the wallets in cases where this high-level
security is not necessary.

* The Wallet Instance SHALL keep a record of the communication with the
  Relying Party (as per article 6a(3.ae) \[eIDAS 2.0\].


#### 7.5.2 General Relying Party authentication mechanism
In essence, a Relying Party authentication mechanism works as follows:

1. The Relying Party Instance SHALL create a signature over some data in
   the protocol for the request, using a Relying Party Instance private
   key. 
2. The Relying Party Instance SHALL include its certificate[^22] (and all
   other certificates in the trust chain leading up to its trust anchor)
   associated with the private key in the request. The certificate SHALL
   be signed (directly or indirectly) by a Certification Authority, whose
   certificate is present in the Wallet Instance as a trust anchor.
3. The Wallet Instance SHALL verify the signature over the request using
   the Relying Party Instance public key.
4. The Wallet Instance SHALL verify that the signature of the
   Certification Authority over the Relying Party Instance certificate -
   and all other certificates in the trust chain leading up the trust
   anchor - is correct. 
5. The Wallet Instance SHALL validate that the CA that issued the
   certificate for the Relying Party Instance, did not revoke since then
   the certificate of the Relying Party Instance, or any other
   certificate in the trust chain leading up to its trust anchor). 

Below is a high-level sequence diagram for Relying Party Authentication,
independent of the protocol beneath for retrieving the attestations;

![Figure 8. High-level sequence diagram for Relying Party Authentication.](media/image8.png)
*Figure 8. High-level sequence diagram for Relying Party Authentication*

Section 7.5.8 specifies in detail how Relying Party authentication SHALL be implemented by ISO-compliant Wallet Instances and Relying Party Instances. Section 7.5.9 describes the same for SD-JWT-compliant Wallet Instances and Relying Party Instances.

#### 7.5.3 Relying Party authentication mechanisms
As explained above, for the authentication process, each Relying Party
Instance SHALL have a unique Relying Party Instance certificate. This
certificate SHALL be signed (directly or indirectly) by a Relying Party
root Certificate Authority.

To obtain certificates for its Relying Party Instances, each Relying
Party SHALL therefore register itself and after going through this
process successfully, a registered Relying Party SHALL obtain the Relying
Party Instance certificates it needs for all of its Relying Party
Instances. 

During the authentication of a Relying Party Instance, it is necessary to
validate the certificate of that Relying Party Instance, and the whole
chain of trust up to the anchor of trust. 

#### 7.5.4 Relying Party authentication trust infrastructure
Within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, Relying Party Instance certificates
SHALL be signed by a Certification Authority. Each CA in the trust chain
SHALL employ operational and security practices that are sufficient to
guarantee the trustworthiness of the certificates it issues. Each CA
SHALL document these operational and security practices in a Certificate
Policy complying with \[EN 319 411\].

#### 7.5.5 A risk-based approach to Relying Party authentication failures
This section outlines a risk analysis for each failure reason and proposes an action for the Wallet Instance. If Relying Party authentication fails for any reason, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release the requested attributes to the Relying Party when failures listed below occur.

There are quite a few reasons for which a Relying Party authentication mechanism as described in section 7.5.2 can fail or indicate a MITM attack. This document categorizes these reasons in the following manner:

| No. | Reason for failure | Associated risk |
|-----|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1   | The Relying Party request does not contain a signature created by the Relying Party Instance. | If the request does not contain a Relying Party Instance signature, most probably the Relying Party did not yet register itself and the Relying Party Instance does have a Relying Party Instance key pair and/or an associated Relying Party Instance certificate. This does not imply that the Relying Party is untrustworthy. In fact, it will probably take a long time after the start of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem before most Relying Parties are registered, and we may never reach a point where 100% of all Relying Parties are registered. If this error occurs, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release any attributes to the Relying Party. |
| 2   | The Relying Party signature is wrong. | In this case, the Relying Party Instance signed the wrong data, for example data that does not represent the requested attributes. Alternatively, to create the signature, the Relying Party Instance used a private key not corresponding to the public key in the Relying Party Instance certificate. In both cases, there is a real risk that a Man-In-The-Middle attack is going on or that a fake Relying Party Instance attempts to use another Relying Party certificate. If this error occurs, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release any attributes to the Relying Party. |
| 3   | The signature over the Relying Party Instance certificate (or any of the other CA certificates in the trust chain) is wrong. | If the signature over the Relying Party Instance certificate or any of the other CA certificates in the trust chain is wrong, there is a real risk that the Relying Party attempted to create its own (fake) certificate or other CA. If this error occurs, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release any attributes to the Relying Party. |
| 4   | The Wallet Instance does not contain the trust anchor indicated in the Relying Party Instance certificate (or in a higher-level CA certificate, if a multiple-level PKI is used). | If the Wallet Instance does not contain the trust anchor indicated in the certificate, several things can have gone wrong. Perhaps the Relying Party authentication CA changed its key pair recently, and the Wallet Instance did not update its trust anchors yet. However, there is also a possibility that the Relying Party attempted to create its own fake CA. Therefore, if this error occurs, the Wallet Instance SHOULD attempt to update its trust anchors. If that is not possible, or the problem persists, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release any attributes to the Relying Party. |
| 5   | The Relying Party Instance certificate (or any of the other CA certificates in the trust chain) has expired. | If the Relying Party Instance certificate, or any of the other CA certificates in the trust chain has expired, the problem is most likely due to an omission by the Relying Party to timely update its certificates. This does not imply that the Relying Party is untrustworthy, but the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release any attributes to the Relying Party. |
| 6   | The Relying Party Instance certificate (or any of the other CA certificates in the trust chain) has been revoked. | If the Relying Party Instance certificate or any of the other CA certificates in the trust chain, has been revoked, this means that the issuer of that certificate has concluded that the certificate cannot be trusted anymore and has actively taken measures to prevent that Wallet Instances from using this certificate. If this error occurs, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT release any attributes to the Relying Party. |

Note: A more detailed risk analysis may be performed on this section if
deemed necessary.

#### 7.5.6 Relying Party authentication Wallet-to-Wallet communication
To be done.

#### 7.5.7	Informing the User about Relying Party authentication outcomes
The Wallet Instance SHALL inform the User about the outcome of Relying
Party authentication. This document does not contain detailed guidance
for how the Wallet Instance must do this. However, it requires that,

* If Relying Party authentication succeeds, then the Wallet Instance
  SHALL show the name in the Relying Party name extension of the Relying
  Party Instance certificate (see 7.5.8.2) to the User. The Wallet
  Instance can do this when asking for User approval (see section 7.7).
  For example, the Wallet Instance MAY use a phrase like '<Relying Party
  name> asks for the following: <first_name, birth_date, etc.>. Do you
  agree?" This is only an example of a response.
* If Relying Party authentication fails, the Wallet Instance SHALL inform
  the User. For example, the Wallet Instance MAY use a phrase like "A
  party claiming to be '<Relying Party name>' is asking for data. This
  party is untrusted. For your security, the transaction will be
  cancelled."

Additionally, if Relying Party authentication fails, the Wallet Instance
MAY inform the User about the reason for failure

#### 7.5.8 Relying Party authentication mechanism for ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant Wallet Instances

##### 7.5.8.1 Implementation notes
Relying Party Instances interacting with an ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant
Wallet Instance SHALL implement the general Relying Party authentication
mechanism outlined in section 7.5.2 as follows:

1. For step 1, a Relying Party Instance SHALL implement mdoc reader
   authentication as specified in \[ISO/IEC 18013-5\]. Using this
   mechanism, the Relying Party Instance signs contextual information in
   the request (called the SessionTranscript), which includes the Wallet
   Instance ephemeral public key for session encryption. 
2. Regarding step 2, the public key of the Relying Party Instance
   interacting with an ISO-compliant Wallet Instance SHALL be included in
   a Relying Party Instance certificate. \[ISO/IEC 18013-5\] specifies the
   format of this certificate under the name of mdoc reader
   authentication certificate. However, for use within the EUDI Wallet
   ecosystem, there is a need for additional information in the Relying
   Party Instance certificate. The format of the ISO-compliant Relying
   Party Instance certificate to be used within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem
   is specified in section 7.5.8.2.
3. For step 3, the Wallet Instance SHALL validate the signature of the
   Relying Party Instance over the data in the request in the manner
   specified for mdoc reader authentication in \[ISO/IEC 18013-5\].
4. For step 4, the Wallet Instance SHALL validate the Relying Party
   Instance certificate and all other CA certificates in the trust chain,
   if any. The Wallet Instance SHALL use the method specified in clause
   9.3.3 of ISO/IEC 18013-5. To enable this, each Wallet Instance SHALL
   contain one or more Relying Party authentication root CA public keys
   as a trust anchor for Relying Party authentication. These public keys
   SHALL be distributed in the form of root certificates, which SHALL
   have the format specified in section  7.5.8.3. Comment: Both steps 3
   and 4 are required, even though they MAY be implemented in a different
   order, that is â€“ first the trust chain will be validated (step 4) and
   afterwards the signature will be validated (step 3).
5. For step 5, if the Relying Party Instance requests the release of a
   Relying Party-specific pseudonym for the User, the Wallet Instance
   SHALL use the Relying Party unique ID from the Relying Party Instance
   certificate to derive the pseudonym (or identify it if the Wallet
   Instance already has a pseudonym for this Relying Party). If the
   Relying Party unique ID is not present in the certificate, the Wallet
   Instance SHALL NOT release a Relying Party -specific pseudonym.
6. For step 6, the Wallet Instance SHALL verify that the Relying Party
   authentication root CA did not revoke the Relying Party Instance
   certificate or any other CA certificates in the trust chain. To do
   this, it SHALL use the CRL distribution point or OCSP access location
   indicated in the certificate.

##### 7.5.8.2 Relying Party Instance certificate format 
The Relying Party Instance certificate format SHALL comply with the
requirements for mdoc reader authentication certificates in Appendix
B.1.7 of \[ISO/IEC18013-5\], with the following exceptions:

* The OID to be used for a Relying Party Instance dedicated to a specific
  attestation (see section 7.5.3) SHALL be specified in the applicable
  Rule Book.
* As discussed in \[PseudonymRulebook\], a Relying Party MAY request a
  Wallet Instance for an Relying Party-specific pseudonym. To be able to
  do so, the Wallet Instance needs a unique and persistent identifier for
  the Relying Party. Therefore, if an Relying Party wants to use an
  Relying Party-specific pseudonym, it SHALL ensure that its Relying
  Party Instance certificates contain a relying party unique ID
  extension. 
* The Relying Party Instance certificate SHALL contain the legal name for
  the Relying Party in the subject's Common Name, which the Wallet
  Instance can show to the User when asking for User approval, see
  section 7.6.1. The Relying Party Instance certificate MAY contain a
  Relying Party name extension that further defines the Relying Party
  service that, if existent, will also be shown to the User.

##### 7.5.8.3 Relying Party authentication root CA certificate format
The Relying Party authentication root CA certificate format SHALL comply
with the requirements for Issuing Authority CA certificates in Appendix
B.1.2 of \[ISO/IEC18013-5\], with the following exceptions:

* The validity period of this certificate SHALL be 5 years maximum.
* For the Provider field, the requirements regarding the issuing_country
  data element (for countryName) and the issuing_jurisdiction data
  element (for stateOrProvinceName) SHALL be disregarded. Where the
  issuing country is mentioned, this SHALL be taken to refer to the
  country in which the Relying Party authentication root CA is
  established.â€ƒ

#### 7.5.9 Relying Party authentication mechanism for SD-JWT-compliant Wallet Instances  
To be done.

### 7.6 Relying Party authorization
There is a risk that relying parties may over-ask, i.e., ask a Wallet
instance for more attributes than the Relying Party reasonably needs for
its use case. This is obviously a risk for the privacy of the user, and
this risk must be mitigated. At least three approaches can in principle
be used to protect the user against over-asking: the user approval
mechanism discussed in Chapter 4, technical measures in the Wallet
Instance, and legal and organizational measures on Member State or EU
level. 


#### 7.6.1 User approval as a means for Relying Party authorization
User Approval protects against over-asking by allowing the User to refuse
sharing attributes that they deem unnecessary for the specific use case
and the specific Relying Party they are dealing with. 

User approval SHALL be implemented in all use cases.

However,  User Approval has some limitations that MAY make it
insufficiently effective in preventing Relying Parties from over-asking,
as described below: 

* Firstly, it makes the User solely responsible for verifying (and
  preventing) that the Relying Party does not misbehave. This puts a
  heavy burden on the User's level of knowledge and awareness. For
  example, if a Relying Party present the release of all requested
  attributes as a precondition for the use case that is going on, a User
  may not have the resources to determine whether this is indeed the
  case, or to judge the impact of sharing attributes that the Relying
  Party does not actually need. Moreover, Users will be tempted to
  release all requested attributes, just to ensure they can enjoy the
  benefits of the use case.
* Secondly, although  User Approval may prevent a misbehaving Relying
  Party from over-asking in individual cases, it does not provide
  authorities with a means to solve disagreements between User and
  Relying Party as to what attributes can be reasonably requested, and
  neither does it allow authorities to detect and penalize Relying
  Parties that over-ask.


### 7.7 User approval
In this document the term 'User approval' exclusively refers to a User's
decision to release an attribute to the Relying Party requesting it.
Under no circumstances User approval to releasing data from their EUDI
Wallet Instance SHOULD be construed as lawful grounds for the processing
of personal data by the Relying Party or any other party. Relying Party
or any party requesting or processing personal data from a EUDI Wallet
Instance SHALL ensure that they have grounds for lawful processing that
data, according to Article 6 of the GDPR.


#### 7.7.1 Overview
User approval refers to a decision by a User to release one or more
attributes to a Relying Party that is requesting these attributes. This
document requires the following:

1. A Wallet Instance SHALL always ask the User to approve any release of
   an attribute in the Wallet Instance to any Relying Party.
2. A Wallet Instance SHALL authenticate the User before allowing the User
   to give or refuse approval.
3. A Relying Party SHALL be able to distinguish between attributes that
   are critical for its use case, and those that are optional. If so, a
   Wallet Instance SHALL ensure that the User approval for critical
   attributes is granted on an 'all or nothing' basis. For optional
   attributes, User approval is granted per attribute.

These requirements are explained in more detail in the next subsections.
This document does not specify any further details on how Wallet
Providers SHALL implement a User's approval mechanism.

#### 7.7.2 Asking for User approval
A Wallet Instance SHALL always ask the User to give approval for any
attribute released. This goes for any use case, both in proximity and
remote, and including:

* Use cases where the Relying Party could be assumed to be trusted, for
  example when the Relying Party is part of law enforcement or another
  government agency.
* Use cases where the requested attributes are critical for the Relying
  Party to grant access to the User or deliver the requested services.
* Use cases where there is, according to the GDPR or other legislation,
  no (legal) need to ask for the User's approval because another legal
  basis exists for requesting the attributes.

This principle is a basic protection of the User's privacy. It also
ensures a consistent User experience. Moreover, this principle means that
the level of control Users have over their attributes is not less than in
the existing 'plastic-card based' situation. That is, a User SHALL always
be able to refuse presenting an attribute that is requested by a Relying
Party, even when knowing that the consequence of that refusal may have
negative consequences for the User.

Note: Attributes that the Relying Party intends to store is regulated
GDPR. This feature is seen as preference known in ISO as "intent to
retain" and is included in the ARF as "privacy by design" element.

#### 7.7.3 User authentication and User approval
A Wallet Instance SHALL authenticate the User before allowing the User to
approve the request. This means that the Wallet Instance SHALL verify
that the person handling the Wallet Instance and approves the request is
the User, i.e., the person to whom the attributes in the attestation
apply. If this is not the case, then the person handling the Wallet
Instance is legally not allowed to approve to release the attributes.

Note that this requirement is slightly different from the requirement of
User binding discussed in section 6.3.2.5. In some use
cases, for example in attended proximity use cases, the Relying Party can
use a portrait of the User to do User binding, if that portrait is issued
as an attribute in an attestation. Obviously, this is not a possibility
for a Wallet Instance. 

Wallet Instances therefore have no choice but to trust the User
authentication mechanisms present on or connected to the device on which
the Wallet Instance is installed. The discussions in the third bullet of
section 6.3.2.5 therefore apply for User authentication by the Wallet
Instance as well.

Note that use cases in which the User and the subject of the attributes
are two different persons, such as when somebody has power of attorney or
custodianship, are out of scope of this version of this document. 

## 8 The Certification process of EUDI Wallets Solutions
Member States, according to Article 6c (3) of the proposal, SHALL
designate accredited CABs which will oversee carrying out conformity
assessment of EUDI Wallets Solutions. This designation process should be
harmonised between Member States.

Once this designation has been made, Member States SHALL communicate to
the European Commission the names and addresses of these public or
private bodies under Article 6c(5) of the proposal. 

EUDI Wallet Provider SHALL request (select, contract) one or more
designated CABs to assess and certify the conformity of their EUDI Wallet
Solution against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.

EUDI Wallet certification is conducted by the CAB to evaluate and certify
the conformity of the EUDI Wallet Solution (target of the certification)
against normative document(s) which will be the Art. 6a(11) implementing
act(s) on technical and operational specifications and reference
standards. The EUDI Wallet SHALL be certified to ensure conformity
assessments but also security robustness assessment of conformance to a
high level of security.

The use of a cybersecurity certification scheme should bring a harmonised
level of trust in the security of EUDI Wallet Solution. The secure
storage of cryptographic material is expected to become subject to
cybersecurity certification too. 

The Certification process of EUDI Wallet Providers should leverage, rely
on, and mandate the use of relevant and existing Cybersecurity Act
certification schemes, or parts thereof, to certify the compliance of
wallets, or parts thereof, with the applicable cybersecurity
requirements.

## 9 The Architecture and Reference Framework Development Process

### 9.1 Publication
This document and the backlog items are made publicly available at 
the [EU Digital Identity Wallet repository in GitHub](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework/), where it will be regularly updated according to the workflow described 
in Chapter 9.2.

- <https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework/>


### 9.2 Update
To ensure steady and fast progress on elaborating and updating this
document, the following process and work methodology is applied.

The eIDAS Expert Group SHOULD maintain a backlog, which is a prioritised
list of work items to complete the ARF. The backlog will be updated based
on feedback from the eIDAS Expert Group, LSPs, the Commission or other
stakeholders such as international standardisation organisations. For
instance, feedback from the development of the reference implementation
of an EUDI Wallet and ensuing drafts of detailed technical specifications
may prompt new work items.

The European Commission (DG CONNECT) will organise the work on the
backlog items and will facilitate that work is progressing according to
the expected timeline.

The eIDAS Expert Group will regularly discuss and compare different
proposals regarding technical solutions, recommendations and requirements
related to the relevant backlog issue with a view of updating the ARF.
The eIDAS Expert Group SHALL in this regard maintain a list of
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), so that it is possible to keep
track of and understand the motivation behind technical decisions
described in the ARF.

Any changes and/or updates to this document SHALL be agreed by the eIDAS
Expert Group. The eIDAS Expert Group will convene in regular meetings,
with the objective to discuss and approve new release of this document,
as well as updating the development backlog. 

This document will be aligned to the outcome of the legislative
negotiations of the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework
with updates being made accordingly.


#### 9.2.1 Document versioning

To avoid interoperability issues and changes to the ARF going unnoticed,
version control system and the following semantic versioning scheme will
be used for the ARF.

The ARF document will have a given version number following the format
*MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH*, where:

**MAJOR** version is incremented (i.e., new version), when the ARF
document has undergone significant changes, for example introducing some
breaking changes in the architecture,

**MINOR** version is incremented when new information has been added to
the document or information has been removed from the document, and

**PATCH** version is incremented when minor changes have been made
(e.g., fixing typos).

[^15]: Please note that work on further specifying the EUDI Wallet
    Instance Attestation is planned to be carried out. This section may

    cases nor are alternative possibilities excluded from consideration.

    (by requiring support for ISO/IEC 18013-5 and SD-JWT)

[^17]: Preferably the same Issuer that also signed the other attributes
    that were released. However, the combined presentation of attributes
    originating from different attestations will be further detailed in
    a future version of this document.

[^18]: Note that this implies that Relying Parties SHALL also trust
    device binding, see section 6.2.3.4. The Relying Party trusts that
    the attestation is bound to a device trusted by the Provider, and
    subsequently trusts that this device has properly authenticated the
    User.

[^19]: A PID MAY be an exception: because the concept of a PID is new, it
    is not known yet what validity period PID Providers will use for
    their PIDs, and if there will be a difference between the
    administrative validity period as seen by the User and the
    cryptographic validity period of the attestation.

[^20]: In this case, an alternative to revocation is that the pharmacy
    backend marks the prescription as used, and all pharmacies check that
    backend before handing out the medicines. This goes in fact for any
    attestation: if there is a backend system that allows Relying Parties
    to verify whether the attestation is still usable, then revocation is
    not needed. However, we cannot assume that such a backend system
    exists for all attestations that can be â€˜consumedâ€™, i.e., that must
    become unusable once they have been used.

[^21]: The current version of \[JWTStatusList\] does not explicitly
    describe such a procedure. The EC will point out to the authors that
