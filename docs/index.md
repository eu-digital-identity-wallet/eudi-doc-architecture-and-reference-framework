# European Digital Identity Wallet

![Digital Identity for all Europeans - A personal digital wallet for EU citizens and residents](./media/top-banner-arf.png)

The [eIDAS Regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation)
allows EU Member States to notify and recognise each other's national electronic
ID systems. Since 2018, any scheme that has been notified must be recognised
across the EU. But there's no obligation for every country to create its own
electronic ID or to make it work with others. This has led to big differences
from one Member State to another.  

The new [European Digital Identity Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/2024-10-18)
is designed to fix these gaps. It makes the rules more effective and also opens
them up to the private sector. Every Member State will now offer people and
businesses a **European Digital Identity Wallet**. These wallets will let users connect
different parts of their national digital identity in one secure app. They can
be provided directly by governments or by private companies, as long as they are
officially recognised.  

The EU Digital Identity Wallet will be:

* **made available to anyone who wants to use it**: Any EU citizen, resident,
  and business in the EU who would like to make use of the EU Digital Identity
  will be able to do so.
* **used widely**: EU Digital Identity Wallets will be used as a way to
  identify users when providing them with access to public and private digital
  services across the EU.
* **controlled by users**: The EU Digital Identity Wallets will enable people
  to choose and keep track of their identity, data and certificates which they
  share with third parties. Anything which is not necessary to share will not
  be shared.

Consumers should also be able to access services online without having to use
private platforms or unnecessarily sharing personal data. They will have full
control of the data they share.

## Architecture and Reference Framework

On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation ([COMMISSION
RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a
[Common Union Toolbox](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-toolbox)
for a coordinated approach towards a [European Digital Identity Framework](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946),
 [OJ L 210/51, 14.6.2021](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2021%3A210%3AFULL))
calling on Member States to work closely together with the Commission towards
the development of a Toolbox including a technical Architecture and Reference
Framework (hereinafter the ARF), a set of common standards and technical
specifications and a set of common guidelines and best practices.

The Recommendation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis for the
implementation of the [European Digital Identity Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/2024-10-18),
without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering with, or prejudging
the legislative process.

The Recommendation establishes a structured framework for cooperation between
Member States, the Commission, and, where relevant, private sector operators to
develop the Toolbox. The European Digital Identity Cooperation Group (EDICG),
formerly known as the eIDAS Expert Group, is responsible for:

* exchange best practices and cooperate with the Commission on emerging
policy initiatives in the field of digital identity wallets, electronic
identification means and trust services;
* advising the Commission in the preparation of draft implementing and delegated
acts;
* supporting Supervisory Bodies in the implementation of the [European Digital
Identity Regulation];
* organising peer reviews of electronic identification schemes;
* engaging with the Commission and other relevant stakeholders to develop a
[Common Union Toolbox](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-toolbox);

The European Digital Identity Cooperation Group's page can be found
[at the official page](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-digital-identity-cooperation-group).

The European Digital Identity Cooperation Group has since further developed the
concepts and specifications for the European Digital Identity Framework. The
current ARF version is based on the [legal text adopted](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/2024-10-18)
