# ANNEX 2 - High Level Requirements <!-- omit from toc -->


## A.2 High level requirements

### A.2.1 Introduction 

#### A.2.1.1 Overview 

This annex to the [ARF 1.4.0](../../arf.md) includes high-level requirements (HLRs)
related to the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. The requirements define the
responsible actor that should implement each requirement. There are no
requirements imposed on the Users.

All requirements in this Annex only apply in the context of the EUDI
Wallet ecosystem. Attestations that are not bound to or used by Wallet
Instances are not included in the scope of this Annex.

#### A.2.1.2 Key words 

This annex uses the capitalized key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119), i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations
and options specified in this annex.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalized) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e., a requirement that is not mandated by this document,
but, for instance, by an external standard or specification. The word
'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', and
'is' or 'are', are intended as statements of fact.

### A.2.2 Structure and order of presentation of the HLRs 

Topics presented in [Section A.2.3](##a23-high-level-requirements) are ordered by a Topic number.

Each Topic includes a short description, followed by the High-Level
Requirements (HLRs), identified by a unique identifier. The identifier
includes a prefix which signifies the context of the HLRs (e.g. - ISSU
for issuance), an underscore and a numerator, e.g. - ISSU_10.

Note: If required, a reference will be made from a topic to a white
paper or to a technical report, which elaborates on the background or
content of the subject matter.Â 

### A.2.3 High-Level Requirements  

#### A.2.3.1 Topic 1 - Accessing Public and Private Online Services with EUDI Wallet 

*Short description*

The primary purpose of the EUDI Wallet is to offer secure identification
and authentication of users at a high Level of Assurance (LoA) for both
public and private online services. This essential functionality ensures
that Relying Parties can confidently verify that they are interacting
with the correct users.

In this use case, users are utilizing the EUDI Wallet to confirm their
identity. The users frequently access online services that demand
authentication and currently employ multiple methods for identity
verification while accessing these services. The users are also
concerned about sharing Person Identification Data (PID) during online
interactions. Their objectives include identifying themselves with
services requiring User identification and maintaining control over
personal data sharing.

This Topic contains high-level requirements related to online
identification and authentication of users utilizing their EUDI Wallets.

#### A.2.3.2 Topic 2 - Mobile Driving Licence with EUDI Wallet 

*Short description*

A User can obtain from a mobile Driver's Licence (mDL) Provider and
store in an EUDI Wallet Instance, their mDL. A User can then present the
mDL to a Relying Party upon request to prove their driving rights
conveniently, securely, and in compliance with the regulations of all
Member States.

This Topic contains high-level requirements related to a User presenting
a mobile Driver's Licence (mDL) to a Relying Party officer in a
supervised scenario, and also in an unsupervised scenario, in proximity
offline mode.

*High level requirements*

No high-level requirements are identified for this Topic, as the mDL is
an attestation that must comply with all relevant requirements in other
Topics.

#### A.2.3.3 Topic 3 - PID Rulebook 

*Short description*

The Person Identification Data (PID) Rulebook contains requirements
specific to the PID use case within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

The PID Rule Book contains the following main topics:

1.  The PID attribute schema: This describes the structure, the type,
    the entity identifiers, and the logical organization of the
    mandatory and optional attributes of the PID. It also describes how
    Member States can specify any possible national attributes. Two
    encodings for these attributes are specified, one compliant with
    \[ISO18013-5\], the other compliant with \[SD-JWT\].

2.  The trust infrastructure necessary for PIDs, for both ISO/IEC
    18013-5-compliant and SD-JWT-compliant encodings.

For more information, see Annex 3 - \[PID Rulebook\].

*High level requirements*

| **Index** | **High Level Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| PID_01 | PIDs and PID Providers SHALL comply with all requirements in \[PID Rulebook\]. |

#### A.2.3.4 Topic 4 - mDL Rulebook 

*Short description*

The mobile driving licence (mDL) Rulebook contains requirements specific
to the mDL use case within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

Mobile driving licences are legally specified in the proposed EC
Regulation 2023_127 (4th Driving Licence Regulation). This Regulation
specifies that mDLs shall comply with the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard. It
does not mention any other standards, in particular not \[SD-JWT\].
Consequently, mDLs issued to a Wallet instance will not be implemented
as \[SD JWT\]- compliant documents. The mDL Rulebook therefore specifies
only an ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant encoding

For more information, see Annex 3 - \[mDL Rulebook\].

*High level requirements*

| **Index** | **High Level Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| mDL_01 | mDLs and mDL Providers SHALL comply with all requirements in \[mDL Rulebook\]. |

#### A.2.3.5 Topic 5 - EUDI Wallet Design Guide 
There are no HLRs for this Topic.

#### A.2.3.6 Topic 6 - Relying Party authentication and User Approval  

*Short description*

Relying Party authentication is a process whereby a Relying Party proves
its identity to a Wallet Instance, in the context of a transaction in
which the Relying Party requests the Wallet Instance to release some
attributes.

To perform Relying Party authentication, the Wallet Instance verifies a
Relying Party access certificate offered by the entity with which it
communicates, which is called a "Relying Party Instance". Note that
there could be multiple Relying Party Instances for each Relying Party.

*High level requirements*

A.  Relying Party authentication:

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|--------------|
| RPA_01 | The Wallet Instance used by a User, as well as the Relying Party Instance used by the Relying Party, SHALL implement a mechanism for Relying Party authentication. This mechanism SHALL: <ul><li>enable the Wallet Instance to identify and authenticate the Relying Party,</li><li>enable the Wallet Instance to verify that the request from the Relying Party was not copied and replayed,</li><li>use Relying Party access certificates issued in accordance with \[[Topic 27](#a2327-topic-27---relying-party-registration)\].</li></ul> |
| RPA_02 | The Commission SHALL ensure that technical specifications for the Relying Party authentication mechanism mentioned in RPA_01 are created both for Wallet Instances complying with \[ISO/IEC 18013-5\] and for Wallet Instances complying with \[OpenID4VP\]. These specifications SHALL comply with applicable requirements in these standards. |
| RPA_03 | A Wallet Instance and a Relying Party Instance SHALL perform Relying Party authentication in all use cases, whether proximity or remote. <p><br>Note: The actions both entities perform differ. For example, while the Relying Party creates a signature over some data in the request, the Wallet Instance validates that signature. |
| RPA_04 | For the verification of Relying Party access certificates, a Wallet Instance SHALL accept the trust anchors in the Trusted List(s) of Relying Party Access CAs of all Member States. <p><br>Note: For more information about Relying Party Access Certificate Authorities, please see \[[Topic 31](#a2331-topic-31---pid-provider-wallet-provider-attestation-provider-and-access-certificate-authority-notification-and-publication)\]. |
| RPA_05 | If Relying Party authentication fails for any reason, the Wallet Instance SHALL NOT allow the User to release the requested attributes to the Relying Party. |
| RPA_06 | If Relying Party authentication succeeds, the Wallet Instance SHALL display to the User the name of the Relying Party as included in the Relying Party Instance access certificate, together with the attributes requested by the Relying Party. The Wallet Instance SHALL do so when asking the User for approval according to RPA_08. |


B.  User approval:

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|--------------|
| RBA_09 | A Wallet Instance SHALL ensure the User approved the release of any attribute(s) in the Wallet Instance to a Relying Party, prior to releasing the attribute. A Wallet Instance SHALL always allow the User to refuse releasing an attribute requested by the Relying Party. |
| RBA_10 | A Wallet Instance SHALL ensure that the WSCA has authenticated the User, before allowing the User to give or refuse approval for releasing any attributes. <p><br>Note: See \[[Topic 09](#a239-topic-9---wallet-trust-evidence)\] for information about the WSCA. |
| RBA_11 | A Relying Party SHOULD group the attributes they request based on the use case, service, or purpose for which it requests these attributes. A Wallet Instance SHOULD ensure that for each group the User gives approval either to release all requested attributes, or none of them. |

#### A.2.3.7 Topic 7 - Attestation validity checks and revocation 

*Short description*

This Topic contains the high-level requirements (HLRs) which relate to
validity checks and revocation of PIDs, attestations (e.g., QEAAs,
PuB-EAAs and EEAs).

Note: This Topic does not pertain to access certificates for Relying
Parties, PID Providers or Attestation Providers as discussed in [Topic
31](#a2331-topic-31---pid-provider-wallet-provider-attestation-provider-and-access-certificate-authority-notification-and-publication). Neither does it apply to any intermediate certificates establishing
trust between these certificates and the respective trust anchors. These
certificates are part of a Public Key Infrastructure (or an OpenID
Federation, or a similar trust framework), and rules for revoking these
certificates will be established within the respective PKI or trust
framework.

*High level requirements*

| **Index** | **High Level Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| VCR_01 | The PID Provider of a given PID, or the Attestation Provider of a given attestation, SHALL be the only party in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem capable of executing the revocation or suspension of that PID or attestation. Similarly, the Wallet Provider of a given WIA SHALL be the only party in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem capable of executing the revocation or suspension of that WIA. <p><br>Note: A PID Provider, Attestation Provider or Wallet Provider MAY outsource the operation of the revocation process to a third party. |
| VCR_02 | A PID Provider or Attestation Provider that revoked a PID or attestation SHALL NOT reverse the revocation. |
| VCR_03 | A PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL have a policy specifying under which conditions a PID or attestation it issued will be revoked or suspended. |
| VCR_04 | A PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL revoke a PID or attestation at least: <ul><li>upon the explicit request of the User,</li><li>when its security has been compromised,</li><li>upon the death of the User or cease of activity of the legal person who is the subject of the attestation.</li></ul> |
| VCR_05 | A PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHOULD revoke a PID or attestation, if necessary, rather than suspending it. |
| VCR_06 | If a PID Provider or Attestation Provider has suspended a PID or attestation, it SHALL either unsuspend or revoke that PID or attestation within a period of time specified in the policy mentioned in VCR_03. That policy SHALL also determine the conditions under which the PID or attestation will be unsuspended or revoked. |
| VCR_07 | A PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL revoke a PID or attestation if the value of one or more attributes in the PID or attestation has changed and the attestation is still valid for at least 24 hours. In this situation, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL issue a new PID or attestation with the correct value for the changed attribute. |
| VCR_08 | Wallet Providers SHALL implement the attestation revocation mechanisms specified per VCR_09 in their Wallet Solution(s). |
| VCR_09 | The Commission SHALL create or reference technical specifications providing all necessary details for PID Providers, Attestation Providers, and Wallet Providers to implement an Attestation Status List mechanism and/or an Attestation Revocation List mechanism for the PIDs, attestations and WIAs they issue. These technical specifications SHALL also contain all details necessary for Relying Party Instances and Relying Parties to use these mechanisms to verify the revocation status of PIDs, attestations, and WIAs. <p><br>Note: 'Attestation Status List' and 'Attestation Revocation List' are specific mechanisms, defined in Annex 1. |
| VCR_10 | If a Relying Party decides it needs to verify the revocation status of a PID, or attestation, it SHALL support both the Attestation Status List mechanism and the Attestation Revocation List mechanism specified per VCR_09. <p><br>Note: Per VCR_14, it is not mandatory for a Relying Party to verify whether a PID, or attestation is revoked. |
| VCR_11 | Wallet Providers SHALL support the Attestation Status List mechanism and the Attestation Revocation List mechanism specified per VCR_09 in their Wallet Solution(s). |
| VCR_12 | A PID Provider, QEAA Provider, or PuB-EAA Provider SHALL use one of the following methods for revocation of a PID, QEAA, or PuB-EAA: <ul><li>Only issue short-lived attestations having a validity period of 24 hours or less, such that revocation will never be necessary,</li><li>Use the Attestation Status List mechanism specified per VCR_09, or</li><li>Use the Attestation Revocation List mechanism specified per VCR_09.</li></ul> <br>Note: The 24-hour period originates from the relevant ETSI specifications. These require that the process of revocation must take at most 24 hours. Consequently, revocation makes no sense if the attestation is valid for less than 24 hours, because it will reach the end of its validity period before it is revoked. |
| VCR_13 | For non-qualified EAAs, the relevant Rulebook SHALL determine whether that type of EAA must be revocable. If an EAA type must be revocable, the relevant Rulebook SHALL determine which of the methods mentioned in VCR_12 must be implemented by the relevant EAA Providers for the revocation of an EAA. |
| VCR_14 | A Relying Party SHOULD verify the revocation status of a PID or attestation upon obtaining it from a Wallet Instance, following the steps specified per VCR_09. |
| VCR_15 | When no reliable information regarding the revocation status of a PID, or attestation is available, a Relying Party SHOULD perform a risk analysis considering all relevant factors for the use case, before taking a decision to accept or refuse the PID or attestation. |

#### A.2.3.8 Topic 8 - Design Solutions on Data Sharing scenarios 

There are no HLRs for this Topic.

#### A.2.3.9 Topic 9 - Wallet Trust Evidence  

*Short description*

When a PID Provider or Attestation Provider receives a request from a
User to issue a PID or attestation to the User's EUDI Wallet Instance,
the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to decide whether it can
comply with this request. To determine this, the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider needs to know (among other things) if the Wallet
Instance offers the functional capabilities required by the PID Provider
or Attestation Provider in its PID or attestation issuing policy. In
addition, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to know if the
Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application(s) (WSCA) and the corresponding
Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device(s) (WSCD) used by the Wallet Instance
offer the required level of security. Therefore, the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider needs to receive trustworthy information about
these capabilities and security posture.Â 

This Topic introduces an information object that contains the necessary
information. This object is called the Wallet Trust Evidence (WTE). The
WTE contains a public key. By including this public key in the WTE, the
Wallet Provider attests that the corresponding private key is protected
by a certified WSCA/WSCD that has the properties and security posture
described in the WTE. The PID Provider or Attestation Provider then asks
that WSCA to create a key pair for its new PID or attestation, and to
prove that this new key is associated with the key in the WTE.
Association primarily means that the PID or attestation private key is
protected by the same WSCA as the WTE private key. A full description of
the concept of key association is given in the forthcoming White Paper
on Wallet Trust Evidence. Therefore, the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider can be sure that the security level of the new PID or
attestation key is the same as the security level of the WTE key.Â At the
moment of writing this version of the ARF, it is not fully clear how
many WSCDs will support the cryptographic functionalities necessary to
generate a proof of association. Therefore, the creation of a proof of
association in a WSCA is recommended (SHOULD), not required (SHALL). In
this way, once a Wallet Instance has access to a WSCD/WSCA that supports
the required cryptographic functionalities, proofs of association can be
used as described in this Topic.

Please note that the scope of this document is limited to the question
of how the WTE is issued during Wallet Instance activation and how it is
used during attestation issuance. The role played by the WTE during the
release of an attestation to a Relying Party is discussed in [Topic 18](#a2318-topic-18---relying-party-handling-eudi-wallet-attribute-combined-presentation)
(Combined presentation of attributes).

For more information, see the White Paper on Wallet Trust Evidence that
will be published in the same repository as the ARF.

*High level requirements*

A.  Creating the WTE during Wallet Instance activation

| **Index** | **Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| WTE_01 | A Wallet Provider SHALL have to activate a new Wallet Instance before a User can use it to obtain an attestation. |
| WTE_02 | A WSCA SHALL authenticate the User before performing any cryptographic operation involving a private or secret key of a Wallet Instance (i.e., a WTE key) or of an attestation in a Wallet Instance. |
| WTE_03 | A Wallet Instance SHALL authenticate the User before performing any operation excluding cryptographic operations. The Wallet Instance MAY rely on a WSCA certified to be compliant with applicable requirements for level of assurance "high" to do so, but MAY also rely on other components. <p><br>Note: Cryptographic operations can only be performed by the WSCA after User authentication according to WTE_02. |
| WTE_04 | For a Wallet Instance containing a natural-person PID, the User mentioned in WTE_02 and WTE_03 SHALL be the natural person who is the subject of that PID. |
| WTE_05 | For a Wallet Instance containing a legal-person PID, the User mentioned in WTE_02 and WTE_03 SHALL be a natural person appointed by the legal person who is the subject of that PID. <p><br>Note: This requirement does not imply that the actions of a legal-person Wallet Instance cannot be automated, or that the person(s) controlling the Wallet Instance must authenticate every time the Wallet Instance presents an attestation or creates a seal. The intent is that every operation performed by the legal-person Wallet Instance is performed under the responsibility of a natural person. |
| WTE_06 | A Wallet Provider SHALL only activate a new Wallet Instance if it has verified that: <ul><li>The Wallet Instance has access to at least one WSCA that is certified to be compliant with applicable requirements in this Topic, for level of assurance "high". In addition, the Wallet Instance MAY have access to one or more other WSCAs.</li><li>The private key corresponding to the public key in the WTE (see WTE_07) is protected by the respective WSCA.</li></ul> |
| WTE_07 | During the activation of a new Wallet Instance, a Wallet Provider SHALL sign at least one Wallet Trust Evidence (WTE) and issue it to the Wallet Instance. |
| WTE_08 | The Commission SHALL take measures to ensure that the contents, format and encoding of the Wallet Trust Evidence is specified in a technical specification. Each WTE SHALL describe the Wallet Instance and a certified WSCA available to that Wallet Instance, in such a way that a PID Provider or Attestation Provider processing the WTE is able to take a well-grounded decision on whether to issue an attestation to that Wallet Instance and WSCA. <br>Notes: <ul><li>In general, a PID Provider or Attestation Provider will also need information about the User. Such information is not contained in the WTE.</li><li>The WTE does not contain information allowing a PID Provider or Attestation Provider to verify whether the WTE (and by extension the Wallet Instance) is revoked. Revocation information for the Wallet Instance is instead included in the WIA defined in \[[Topic 38](#a2338-topic-38---wallet-instance-revocation)\].</li></ul> |
| WTE_09 | A Wallet Provider SHALL consider all relevant factors, including the risk of a WTE public key becoming a vector to track the User, when deciding on the validity period of a WTE. A Wallet Provider MAY use short-lived WTEs to mitigate such risks. |
| WTE_10 | A WSCA SHALL generate a new key pair for a new WTE on request of the Wallet Provider via the Wallet Instance. The WSCA SHALL register the new key as a WTE key in an internal registry. The WSCA SHALL register the WTE key as an independent (i.e., non-associated) key in an internal registry. <p><br>Note: A WTE key can be associated later with a PID or attestation key when that PID or attestation key is created, see WTE_13. |
| WTE_11 | A WTE SHALL contain a public key, and the corresponding private key SHALL be generated by the WSCA described in the WTE. <p><br>Note: A WTE key pair is generated as per WTE_10. |
| WTE_12 | In case the Wallet Provider must update the WTE because the information in the WTE is outdated, the Wallet Provider SHALL ensure that the Wallet Instance only releases the latest version of a WTE to an Attestation Provider. |


B.  Using the WTE during issuance of an attestation

| **Index** | **Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| WTE_13 | During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHALL generate a new key pair for a new PID or attestation, on request of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider via the Wallet Instance. The PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL indicate a single WTE public key (see WTE_10) with which the new PID or attestation key must be associated. This indication can either be direct, by providing the WTE public key value, or indirect, by providing a public key value that has been associated with the WTE key previously. In the latter case, the WSCA SHALL look up the associated WTE key in its internal registry. <br>The WSCA SHALL register the new key in an internal registry as an attestation key. The WSCA SHALL register the association between the new private key and the WTE private key in an internal registry. <br>Notes: <ul><li>Direct indication of the WTE is used in case a PID Provider or Attestation Provider indicates during issuing that the new PID or attestation must be associated with a WTE public key, see WTE_15 and WTE_16.</li><li>Indirect indication of the WTE key is used in case an Attestation Provider indicates during issuing that the new attestation must be associated with an existing PID or attestation, see WTE_16.</li></ul> |
| WTE_14 | During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHALL prove possession of the private key corresponding to the new PID or attestation public key, on request of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider via the Wallet Instance, for example by signing a challenge with that private key. |
| WTE_15 | A PID Provider SHALL indicate to a WSCA (via the Wallet Instance) the public key to which the new PID must be associated. This SHALL be a WTE public key. |
| WTE_16 | An Attestation Provider SHALL indicate to a WSCA (via the Wallet Instance) the public key to which the new attestation must be associated. This SHALL be either a WTE public key or the public key of a PID or attestation that already exists in the Wallet Instance. <p><br>Note: if the Attestation Provider indicates a PID or attestation public key, this is an indirect indication of a WTE key, see WTE_13. |
| WTE_17 | During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHALL prove possession of the private key corresponding to a WTE public key on request of a PID Provider or Attestation Provider via the Wallet Instance, for example by signing a challenge with that private key. |
| WTE_18 | During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHOULD generate a proof of association for two or more public keys, if and only if the corresponding private keys are protected by the same WSCA and the WSCA has internally registered an association between these private keys. <br>Notes: <ul><li>It is possible that some private keys in a WSCA are not associated with each other, even though they are managed within the same WSCA.</li><li>If two keys are associated, this implies that they are both associated with the same WTE key. The concept of associated keys is explained in the forthcoming White Paper on Wallet Trust Evidence.</li></ul> |
| WTE_19 | During PID or attestation issuance, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHALL verify that: <ul><li>The WSCA described in the WTE received from the Wallet Instance has proven possession of the private key corresponding to the public key in the WTE (see WTE_17),</li><li>The WSCA has proven possession of the new PID or attestation private key (see WTE_14)</li></ul> In addition, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHOULD verify that: <ul><li>The WSCA has proven association (see WTE_18) between the new PID or attestation public key and the public key requested by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider according to WTE_15 or WTE_16.</li></ul> <br>Notes: <ul><li>See also WTE_13.</li><li>These three proofs MAY be implemented as a single cryptographic proof.</li></ul> |
| WTE_20 | During PID or attestation issuance, a Wallet Instance SHALL provide the PID Provider or Attestation Provider with information on all WSCAs it is able to use for private key management and that comply with the PID Provider's or Attestation Provider's requirements. |
| WTE_21 | During PID or attestation issuance, a Wallet Instance SHALL provide the PID Provider or Attestation Provider with the WTE describing the properties of the WSCA that generated the new PID or attestation private key and protects it. |
| WTE_22 | If a Wallet Instance has access to multiple WSCAs, it SHALL register which PIDs and attestations are bound to each of these WSCAs. |

C.  MiscellaneousÂ 

| **Index** | **Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| WTE_23 | The common OpenID4VCI protocol defined in requirement ISSU_01 SHALL enable a Wallet Instance to transfer a WTE to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider. |
| WTE_24 | A Wallet Instance SHALL release a WTE only to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider, and not to a Relying Party or any other party. |
| WTE_25 | The common OpenID4VCI protocol SHALL enable a Wallet Instance to transfer the proofs of association and possession mentioned in WTE_19 to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider. <p><br>Note: These three proofs MAY be implemented as a single cryptographic proof. |
| WTE_26 | The common OpenID4VCI protocol SHALL enable a Wallet Instance to transfer a public key to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider, to be included in the new PID or attestation. |
| WTE_27 | The common OpenID4VCI protocol SHALL enable a PID Provider or Attestation Provider to indicate in the Token Response: <ul><li>the WSCA to which the new PID or attestation key must be bound, for example by referring to a WSCA identifier listed in the WTE</li><li>or, alternatively, the existing PID or attestation public key with which the new credential key must be associated.</li></ul> |

D.  Overview: Requirements for a WSCA

The technical requirements above imply the following requirements for a
WSCA.

| **Index** | **Requirement** |
|-----------|--------------|
| WTE_28 | A WSCA SHALL be able to verify the authentication factors of a User, in accordance with the requirements in [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502) Section 2.2.1. |
| WTE_29 | A WSCA SHALL be able to generate a new key pair on request of the Wallet Instance. |
| WTE_30 | A WSCA SHALL be able to prove possession of the private key corresponding to a public key on request of a Wallet Instance, for example by signing a challenge with that private key. |
| WTE_31 | A WSCA SHALL register each newly generated key pair as either a WTE key or an attestation key, depending on information provided by the Wallet Instance in the key generation request. The internal registry used by the WSCA for this purpose SHALL be protected against modification by external parties. |
| WTE_32 | A WSCA SHALL protect a private key it generated during the entire lifetime of the key. This protection SHALL at least imply that the WSCA prevents the private key from being extracted in the clear. If a WSCA is able to export a private key in encrypted format, the key used for key encryption SHALL be properly protected, for example as multiple key shares controlled by multiple key custodians. |
| WTE_33 | A WSCA SHALL associate each newly generated attestation key with a WTE key indicated by the Wallet Instance. The WSCA SHALL record the association between these keys in an internal registry, which SHALL be protected against modification by external parties. |
| WTE_34 | For the purposes of WTE_33, a Wallet Instance SHALL indicate the WTE key either directly, by WTE public key value, or indirectly, by value of a public key that is already associated to the intended WTE key. In the latter case, the WSCA SHALL look up the intended WTE key in its registry. |
| WTE_35 | A WSCA SHALL consider two keys to be associated if they are associated to a common WTE key. |
| WTE_36 | A WSCA SHOULD be able to generate a proof of association for two or more public keys. The WSCA SHALL generate such a proof if and only if the corresponding private keys are protected by that WSCA, and the WSCA has internally registered an association between these private keys. |

#### A.2.3.11 Topic 11 - Pseudonym attestation  

*Short description*

The Pseudonym Rulebook contains requirements specific to the pseudonym
use case within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. It specifies a single type of
pseudonym, which will be issued by a Pseudonym Provider to a User having
a Wallet Instance. The pseudonym specified in the Rulebook is not
designed to fit all possible use cases for pseudonyms and to comply with
all possible requirements. Rather, it is intended for basic use case,
namely allowing a Relying Party to recognize a User as someone about
whom the Relying Party already knows something, or with whom the Relying
Party has interacted before. Member States (or other Pseudonym
Providers) MAY specify and implement additional pseudonyms with
different characteristics and add these to their domestic pseudonym
namespace.

For more information, see [Annex 3](../annex-3/annex-3.03_pseudonyms-rulebook.md) - \[Pseudonym Rulebook\].

*High level requirements*

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|--------------|
| PA_01 | Pseudonym Providers, Pseudonym attestations, and Wallet Instances SHALL comply with all applicable requirements in [Pseudonym Rulebook]. |

#### A.2.3.12 Topic 12 - Attestation RulebooksÂ  

*Short description*

This Topic describes the high-level requirements (HLR) for the
Attestation Rulebooks that will specify the details of new types of
attestations, including QEAAs, PuB-EAAs, and non-qualified EAAs. The
goal of this Topic is to ensure that all Rulebooks that will be written
in the future will contain the same type of information and the same
level of detail, such that all attestations are interoperable.

*High level requirements*

A.  Requirements regarding attestation formats

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|--------------|
| ARB_1 | The body responsible for an Attestation Rulebook for a given type of attestation SHALL specify that at least one or more of the following common format(s) must be used for these attestations:                                                            <ul><li>The format specified in ISO/IEC 18013-5, see [ISO18013-5].</li><li>The format specified in "SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC)", see [SD-JWT-VC].</li><li>The format specified in "W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model", see [W3C VCDM v1.1] or [W3C VCDM v2.0]</li><ul> |
| ARB_2 | The body responsible for an Attestation Rulebook SHALL analyse whether it must be possible for a User to present that type of attestation when the Wallet Instance and the Relying Party are in proximity and attestations are presented without using the internet. If so, the Attestation Rulebook SHALL specify that the attestations must be issued in the ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant mdoc format. |
| ARB_3 | The body responsible for an Attestation Rulebook SHALL specify in the Attestation Rulebook whether that type of attestation must be issued in the [SD-JWT VC]-compliant format, provided these documents have been approved by an EU standardization body or by the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 46e(1) of the Regulation. |
| ARB_4 | The body responsible for an Attestation Rulebook MAY specify in the Attestation Rulebook that that type of attestation must be issued in a format compliant with [W3C VCDM v1.1] or [W3C VCDM v2.0], provided it references a document specifying in detail how a Relying Party can request attributes from a such an attestation, and how a User can selectively disclose attributes from such an attestation. This is provided these documents have been approved by an EU standardization body or by the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to [Article 46e](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e4536-1-1)(1) of the Regulation |

B.  Requirements regarding attestation types

#### A.2.3.17 Topic 17 - Identity matching 

*Short description*

Users would like to use their PID to access their existing online
accounts using their EUDI Wallet, even if the identity data is not
exactly the same as in their other accepted eIDs. Users typically have
one or more bank accounts, regularly need to log in the public sector
services, or use online services provided by large platforms. This
enables them to use their preferred eID means for their online
interactions.

*High level requirements*

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|---------------|
| IM_01 | Relying Parties in a Member State, providing cross-border services, SHALL ensure identity matching for natural persons when accessing existing accounts belonging to the same person, employing a risk-based approach.  <br>For purposes of ensuring identity matching, Relying Parties SHALL offer to natural person Users *at least* to:  <ul><li>request the identified EUDI Wallet User to identify with another eID means which is accepted by the Relying Party so to link the data received from the EUDI Wallet with the account to which the User proved to have access to.</li></ul>  In addition, Relying Parties MAY offer natural person Users to:   <ul><li>request for their PID to compare the PID attributes against attributes of existing accounts to verify whether their PID belongs to a current account owner.</li></ul> For purposes of facilitating identity matching by other Member States, Member States SHALL provide to natural person PID-s *at least* four optional attributes of their choice. |

#### A.2.3.18 Topic 18 - Relying Party handling EUDI Wallet attribute combined presentation 

*Short description*

This Topic discusses the combined presentation of attributes by a Wallet
Instance to a Relying Party. 'Combined presentation' here refers to a
transaction in which the Relying Party requests attributes of the same
User from multiple attestations (PID and/or (Q)EAAs) in a single request
and receives those attributes in a single response. These attestations
can be provided by one or by multiple issuers.

This Topic answers the following questions:

-   How can a Relying Party request for a combined presentation of
    attributes?

-   How can a Wallet Instance receiving such a request present the
    attributes in a combined manner?

-   How can the Relying Party verify the authenticity of all released
    attributes in a combined response?

-   How can the Relying Party verify whether all released attributes
    belong to the same User?

Regarding the last question:

-   The User may be either a natural person or a legal person.

-   However, use cases such as delegation or legal representation, where
    the Relying Party may request attributes that are originally part of
    multiple distinct attributes that do not belong to the same User,
    are not combined presentations and are out of scope of this Topic.

*HLRs*

A.  Functional requirements for ecosystem components

| **Index** | **Requirement** |

| ACP_04 | If (as a result of ACP_03) a Wallet Instance determines it must release multiple attestations to a Relying Party in a combined presentation of attributes, it SHALL request a proof of association between the public keys of these attestations from the WSC. |
| ACP_05 | If (as a result of ACP_04), the Wallet Instance receives a proof of association from the WSCA, it SHALL include this proof in the response message containing the combined presentation of attributes and send it to the Relying Party. |
| ACP_06 | If a Relying Party receives a combined presentation of attributes including a proof of association, it SHOULD verify this proof to validate that the attestations in this presentation belong to the same User. |


B.  Process requirements

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|----------------|
| ACP_07 | During issuance of a (Q)EAA, an Attestation Provider SHALL be able to request the association of the new (Q)EAA to a PID or another (Q)EAA already existing on the Wallet Instance, provided that the Attestation Provider has verified during the issuance process that the new (Q)EAA indeed belongs to the User of that existing PID or (Q)EAA. <p><br>Note: Also see requirement WTE_13 in \[Epic 09\] |
| ACP_08 | When receiving a combined presentation of attributes, a Relying Party SHOULD NOT refuse any attestation solely because a proof of association between these attestations is absent. |

C.  Miscellaneous

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| ACP_09 | The common \[ISO18013-5\] and \[OpenID4VP\] protocols SHALL enable a Wallet Instance to transfer a proof of association to a Relying Party. The Commission SHALL take measures to ensure that this is the case. |

#### A.2.3.19 Topic 19 - EUDI Wallet User navigation requirements (Dashboard logs for transparency) 

*Short description*

In this use case, the User is accessing a common dashboard of the EUDI
Wallet Instance which provides a track record of transactions (i.e.
attribute requests and attribute presentations) executed through the
EUDI Wallet. The User is concerned about data privacy, and thus the
function of a dashboard ensures a higher degree of transparency, privacy
and control of the User over their personal data.Â

#### A.2.3.20 Topic 20 - Strong User (Customer) Authentication in the context of electronic payments 

*Short description*

This topic deals with the requirement for Strong User (Customer)
Authentication (SCA) in the context of authenticating an EUDI Wallet
user as part of electronic payments.Â Â 

Users would like to be able to authenticate themselves during online
payments securely and conveniently using their EUDI Wallets, so that
they can enjoy a seamless and protected shopping/ payment experience.Â Â 

The goal is to implement Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for
electronic payments, ensuring a high level of security and compliance
with [Article 97 of the PSD2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj#d1e5540-35-1) (and with the future PSD3/PSR).

[Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj) lays down the requirements
for strong customer authentication (SCA), which needs to be complied
with when accessing a payment account online and for initiating
electronic payments, or carrying out any action through a remote channel
which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses. The use of the
wallet for SCA will be in full compliance with those requirements.Â Â 

In the future, the EUDI wallets could also be used for payments with
Central Bank Digital Currencies.Â Â

#### A.2.3.25 Topic 25 - Unified definition and controlled vocabulary for attestation attributes 

*Short description*

[Topic 12](#a2312-topic-12---attestation-rulebooks) that describes the high-level requirements (HLR) for the
minimal requirements Rulebooks that will specify the details of new
types of attestations, including QEAAs, PuB-EAAs, and non-qualified
EAAs, has already touched and defined high-level requirements regarding
the attestation rulebook catalogue.

The following main concepts were defined in [Topic 12](#a2312-topic-12---attestation-rulebooks) and developed in
the current version of [Topic 25](#a2325-topic-25---unified-definition-and-controlled-vocabulary-for-attestation-attributes): 

-   Attestation Rulebooks for QEAAs and PuB-EAAs used within the EUDI
    Wallet ecosystem MAY be registered and published in a publicly
    accessible catalogue.Â Â 

-   The Attestation Rulebook catalogue MAY also include Attestation
    Rulebooks for non-qualified EAAs.Â Â 

-   The Commission SHALL take measures to establish and maintain the
    Attestation Rulebooks catalogue.Â Â 

-   The Attestation Rulebooks catalogue will enable Attestation
    Providers, Relying Parties, and other actors in the EUDI Wallet
    ecosystem to know which attestation types exist, and what are the
    identifiers, syntax and semantics of all attributes are part of the
    attestation, that they may issue, request and receive from a Wallet
    Instance, according to their role in the ecosystem.Â Â 

The following points are emphasized:Â 

-   Registration in the attestation catalogue is not mandatory.Â Â 

-   Registration in the attestation catalogue does not create any
    obligation or automatic acceptance by any third party, or
    automatically mean cross-border recognition.Â 

-   The Attestation Rulebooks catalogue can be the in the same
    environment as for the catalogue of attributes.

#### A.2.3.28 Topic 28 - EUDI Wallet for legal person 

*Short description*

This topic is focused on identifying high-level requirements for a
legal-person EUDI Wallet. All the core capabilities of the EUDI Wallet
for a natural person are available for a legal person. There are some
differences between a natural and legal person that accordingly leads to
different requirements for issuing legal-person PIDs and the EUDI Wallet
Instances containing legal-person PIDs.Â 

-   A legal-person PID is issued under an eID scheme.

-   A legal-person PID is described in a legal-person PID Rulebook,
    which is different from the natural-person PID Rulebook in \[PID
    Rulebook\]. A legal-person PID has a different attestation type than
    a natural-person PID, and also contains different attributes. For
    example, date of birth or age are not relevant information for legal
    persons. Specifying a different Rulebook for legal-person PIDs
    allows Relying Parties and other EUDI Wallet Instances to request
    these attributes. Â 

-   A legal-person EUDI Wallet Solution may be implemented in the same
    manner as a natural-person Wallet Solution, meaning chiefly that it
    is implemented on a mobile device operated by a single User, who is
    a natural person. However, a legal-person EUDI Wallet Solution may
    also be implemented as a server-based (web-based) application. In
    the latter case, a Wallet Instance can be used either by one or more
    natural persons appointed by the legal person, or by information
    systems of the legal persons that give an EUDI Wallet Instance
    commands in accordance with rules defined by the legal person.Â 

*HLRs*

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|------------------|
| LP_01 | The Commission SHALL develop a Legal-person PID Rulebook to specify the attribute scheme and other technical details applicable for legal-person PIDs. |
| LP_02 | The attestation type of a legal-person PID SHALL be different from the attestation type of a natural person PID. <p><br>Note: See \[[Topic 12](#a2312-topic-12---attestation-rulebooks)\] for an explanation of the concept of attestation type. |
| LP_03 | A legal-person PID SHALL comply with all requirements in the Legal-person PID Rulebook mentioned in LP_02. |

#### A.2.3.29 Topic 29 - Delegation paradigm 

*Short description*

[Topic 3](#a233-topic-3---pid-rulebook) describes requirements for a rulebook of natural-person PIDs. 
[Topic 28](#a2328-topic-28---eudi-wallet-for-legal-person) does the same for legal-persons PIDs.

[Article 5a](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1347-1-1).5.(f) of eIDAS Regulation also mentions the possibility of
issuing eIDs that also could attest a natural person representing the
natural or legal person.Â Â At current time, this Topic proposes to not
describe any requirements for such eID schemes without further Member
State input for such eID schemes. The main reason is that there is no
cross-border legal framework for mutual recognition of powers and
mandates. Powers and mandates are generally legal system-specific and
administrative system-specific.Â Â 

Another use case for delegation is where the recognition of the power
for a person to represent another person occurs on an *ad hoc* basis,
based on a decision by the represented User and in the context of a
specific Relying Party. The basis for such decisions is outside of the
scope of eIDAS. Various scenarios can be considered:

1.  Natural person to natural person, based on the will of the
    represented person: One individual authorizes another individual to
    represent them:Â 

    1.  Picking up a prescription from the pharmacy or a package from
        the post office for a family member.Â 

    2.  Empowering a person to vote on your behalf.Â 

    3.  Empowering a notary to sell your house on your behalf to a
        certain party for a certain amount.Â 

    4.  Empowering your employer to apply for a residence permit on your
        behalf.Â 

2.  Natural person to natural person, based on some decision by an
    authority, or also as a consequence of national, EU or international
    law:Â 

3.  Legal guardian being able to take decisions on behalf of child,
    disabled person, or elderly person.Â 

4.  Natural person to legal person: An individual authorizing a legal
    entity to represent them.Â 

    1.  A person empowering a law firm to be the executor of the trust upon their death.Â 

    2.  A person empowering a bank to invest on their behalf.Â 

*HLRs*

There are no specific requirements in this Topic.Â 

#### A.2.3.30 Topic 30 - Interaction between EUDI Wallets 

*Short description*

An EUDI Wallet User can request from another EUDI Wallet User to share
an attestation of attributes using their EUDI Wallet Instances when
their EUDI Wallet devices are close together (that is, in physical
proximity) with internet connectivity for both devices (online), or
without internet connectivity for both devices (offline).Â

#### A.2.3.32 Topic 32 - PID interoperability 

See [topic 12](#a2312-topic-12---attestation-rulebooks).

#### A.2.3.33 Topic 33 - EUDI Wallet backup and restore 

*Short description*

The relevant scenario for the backup and restore functionality, is when
the User can no longer access the data, the electronic attestations of
attributes and the configurations, that were stored on the mobile device
on which the EUDI Wallet was installed, including its accessories. The
situations may include the mobile device has either been lost, stolen,
broken or hacked (e.g., a result of unauthorized access to the device)
or it malfunctions.Â 

The topic deals with situations when a User replaces an existing
installation of an EUDI Wallet Solution with a new installation of the
same Wallet Solution, when setting up a new mobile device, or after a
factory reset of the same device.Â Â 

The requirements are divided between two situations:Â 

A - Functional requirements for Backup and Restore where a private key
cannot be exported.Â 

B - Functional requirements for Backup and Restore where private key can
be exported or there is no device binding.Â 

> *[<u>Privacy note</u>]: The Backup and Restore Object is
> considered sensitive as the mere existence of certain attributes can
> be sensitive, e.g., a prescription from a fertility Clinique. Also,
> very sensitive attribute information may even not be stored in the
> rich environment of the mobile device but secured through e.g., a
> hardware chip, such that it will never leave that chip in an
> unencrypted way. In that case the Backup and Restore object should
> have similar precautions in that the encryption mechanism must be
> fully performed securely on the secure component of the original
> Wallet solution and the target Wallet solution.*

#### A.2.3.34 Topic 34 - Migrate to a different wallet solution 

*Short description*

The most relevant scenario for this functionality is when a user would
like to migrate from one Wallet solution to a different Wallet solution.
Another scenario would be when the Wallet solution provider ceases to
support the Wallet solution, or even ceases to exist as a Legal Person,
and thus the User is forced to abandon the current Wallet solution and
migrate to a different Wallet solution.

To migrate to a different Wallet solution, there is a need to transfer
the data, the electronic attestations of attributes and the
configurations, that were stored on the mobile device on which the
original EUDI Wallet was installed, including its accessories, to the
different Wallet solution.Â Â 

This topic is similar in some **characteristics to [Topic 33](#a2333-topic-33---eudi-wallet-backup-and-restore) that** deals
with backup and restore to the **same** Wallet solution, but in [Topic 34](#a2334-topic-34---migrate-to-a-different-wallet-solution)
the migration is to a **different** Wallet solution. A main difference
is that the current mobile device that the User would like to migrate
from is still under the control of the User and in the User\'s
possession, and the relevant data that exists on the current Wallet
solution is not lost and is accessible.Â

A.  Issuing a Wallet Instance AttestationÂ 

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|------------|-------------------|
| WIRevocation_01 | To enable a Relying Party or an Attestation Provider to verify the authenticity and revocation status of a Wallet Instance it is interacting with, a Wallet Provider SHALL issue one or more WIAs to the Wallet Instance during the activation phase of a Wallet Instance. |
| WIRevocation_02 | During the lifetime of the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL ensure that the Wallet Instance at all times contains a valid WIA. |
| WIRevocation_03 | The Commission SHALL ensure that a Rulebook for the WIA is created in accordance with all requirements in [Topic 12](#a2312-topic-12---attestation-rulebooks). |
| WIRevocation_04 | The Wallet Provider SHALL manage the issuance processes for WIAs in such a way that the WIAs cannot be misused by colluding Relying Parties (and Attestation Providers) to track a User. |
| WIRevocation_05 | During the activation process of a Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL do the following to ensure that a User can request revocation of their Wallet Instance as mentioned in WIRevocation_10: <ul><li>Register the relationship between this Wallet Instance and its User in a User account;</li><li>Enable secure authentication of the User towards the Wallet Provider is possible, by providing one or more suitable authentication mechanisms. These authentication mechanisms SHALL NOT depend on the mobile device containing the Wallet Instance.</li></ul><p>  Note: <ul><li>The Wallet Provider does not need to know the true identity of the User. Instead, an alias such as an e-mail address can be used.</li><li>The reason for requiring authentication mechanisms that are independent of the Wallet Instance is that the User must be able to authenticate to the Wallet Provider even in case the mobile device containing the Wallet Instance is lost or stolen.</li></ul> |

A.  Revoking a Wallet InstanceÂ 

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|------------|------------------|

If the breach or compromise affects the trustworthiness or reliability of the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL suspend the corresponding WIA(s) if they have a validity period of 24 hours or more. The Wallet Provider SHALL do so at least in the following circumstances: <ul><li>If the security of the Wallet Instance, or the security of the mobile device and OS on which it is installed, or the security of a WSCA it uses for managing cryptographic keys and sensitive data, is breached or compromised in a manner that affects its trustworthiness or reliability.</li><li>If the security of the Wallet Solution is breached or compromised in a manner that affects the trustworthiness or reliability of all corresponding Wallet Instances.</li><li>If the security of the common authentication and data protection mechanisms used by the Wallet Instance is breached or compromised in a manner that affects their trustworthiness or reliability.</li><li>If the security of the electronic identification scheme under which the Wallet Instance is provided is breached or compromised in a manner that affects its trustworthiness or reliability.</li></ul>|
| WIRevocation_10 | A Wallet Provider SHALL revoke a Wallet Instance upon the explicit request of the User registered during the Wallet Instance activation process, see WIRevocation_05. To do so, the Wallet Provider SHALL revoke all valid WIA(s) for that Wallet Instance, if they have a validity period of 24 hours or longer. The Wallet Provider SHALL authenticate the User before revoking the Wallet Instance. |
| WIRevocation_11 | A Wallet Provider SHALL revoke a Wallet Instance upon the explicit request of a PID Provider, in case the natural person using the Wallet Instance has died or the legal person using the Wallet Instance has ceased operations. To do so, the Wallet Provider SHALL revoke all valid WIA(s) for that Wallet Instance, if they have a validity period of 24 hours or longer. To identify the Wallet Instance that is to be revoked, the PID Provider SHALL use the Wallet Instance identifier provided by the Wallet Provider in the WTE during PID issuance. |
| WIRevocation_12 | Before revoking a WIA per WIRevocation_11, the Wallet Provider SHALL verify that the party requesting revocation is indeed a valid PID Provider listed in the Trusted List of PID Providers. |
| WIRevocation_13 | Before requesting a Wallet Provider to revoke a Wallet Instance per WIRevocation_11, the PID Provider SHALL ensure that the revocation does not harm the interests of any of the stakeholders. The PID Provider SHALL have (and follow) a documented policy to ensure that this is the case. |

A.  Informing the User

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|-------------------|
| WIRevocation_14 | A Wallet Provider SHALL inform a User without delay in case the Wallet Provider decided to suspend or revoke the User's Wallet Instance. The Wallet Provider SHALL also inform the User about the reason(s) for the suspension or revocation. This information SHALL be understandable for the general public. It SHALL include (a reference to) technical details about any security breach if applicable. |
| WIRevocation_15 | A Wallet Provider SHALL inform a User without delay in case the Wallet Provider decided to unsuspend the User's Wallet Instance. |
| WIRevocation_16 | To inform a User about the (un)suspension or revocation of their Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL use a communication channel that is independent of the Wallet Instance. In addition, the Wallet Provider MAY use the Wallet Instance itself to inform the User. |

B.  Verifying the revocation status of a Wallet InstanceÂ 

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|------------------|
| WIRevocation_17 | A Wallet Instance SHALL be able to transfer the WIA to PID Providers and Attestation Provider during the issuance of a PID or attestation and to Relying Parties during the presentation of attributes. |
| WIRevocation_18 | A PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHOULD, for each of its valid PIDs or attestations, regularly verify whether the Wallet Provider suspended or revoked the Wallet Instance on which that PID or attestation is residing. If it turns out that the Wallet Instance is suspended or revoked, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHOULD immediately revoke the respective PID or attestation in accordance with all requirements in \[[Topic 7](#a237-topic-7---attestation-validity-checks-and-revocation)\]. |
| WIRevocation_19 | A Relying Party SHOULD verify the revocation status of the Wallet Instance by requesting and verifying a WIA and subsequently verifying the revocation status of the WIA following the steps specified per VCR_09. |
| WIRevocation_20 | For the verification of WIAs, a Relying Party SHALL accept the trust anchors in the Wallet Provider Trusted List(s) of all Member States. <p><br>Note: Wallet Provider Trusted Lists are explained in \[[Topic 31](#a2331-topic-31---pid-provider-wallet-provider-attestation-provider-and-access-certificate-authority-notification-and-publication)\]. |
| WIRevocation_21 | When no reliable information regarding the revocation status of a WIA is available, a Relying Party SHOULD perform a risk analysis considering all relevant factors for the use case, before taking a decision to accept or refuse the Wallet Instance. |

#### A.2.3.42 Topic 42 - Requirements for QTSPs to access authentic sources 

*Short description*

This topic discusses the ability of QTSPs of electronic attestations of
attributes to verify those attributes by electronic means at the request
of the user, wherever those attributes rely on Authentic Sources within
the public sector.Â Â 

*HLRs*

| **Index** | **Requirement specification** |
|-----------|------------------|
| QTSPAS_01 | Member States SHALL define:  <ul><li>discovery mechanisms that enable QTSPs to request information about the Authentic Sources or designated intermediaries recognized at national level (including the attributes about a natural or legal person that the Authentic source or designated intermediary is considered to be a primary source or recognised as authentic in accordance with Union law or national law, including administrative practice);</li><li>procedures for QTSPs to request the verification of attributes from Authentic Sources,</li><li>in accordance with technical specifications referred to in QTSPAS_07, and that comply with QTSPAS_02.</li></ul> |
| QTSPAS_02 | Authentic Sources or designated intermediaries SHALL make available an interface that:  <ul><li>determines whether a verification request for attributes comes from a QTSP of electronic attestation of attributes (so a lookup in the QTSP Trusted List);</li><li>determine whether the QTSP issues the requested attributes, and those attributes rely on an Authentic Source within the public sector;</li><li>if both requirements are met: determine the identity of the user (presumably via a Wallet or any other eIDAS identity scheme to determine the request);</li><li>determine whether the User has given consent;</li><li>after authentication of the user: verify whether the claimed attributes match the info in the authentic source; and finally</li><li>respond with a 'match' or 'no match' for each attribute.</li></ul>   <p>The Commission SHALL take measures to ensure that this interface is specified.<p>  Note: Every QTSP will be able to verify against every authentic source. |
| QTSPAS_03 | Authentic source or designated intermediary SHALL define and implement QTSPAS_001 in a secure and privacy-preserving channel in accordance with technical specifications referred to in QTSPAS_007. |
| QTSPAS_04 | Authentic source or designated intermediary SHALL define and implement QTSPAS_001 so that the QTSP will receive the result of the verification of the requested attributes, as described in QTSPAS_002. If the verification is deferred, the response to the QTSP SHALL include the maximum time that it will take to verify the requested attributes, and a unique identifier that the QTSP SHALL use to obtain the result of the verification. |
| QTSPAS_05 | Member States SHALL define QTSPAS_001 so that the request can be sent by the QTSP directly to the Authentic Source or to a designated intermediary recognized at national level. |
| QTSPAS_06 | Member States SHALL specify the process and mechanisms to designate the authentic sources or intermediaries recognized at national level in accordance with Union or national law, allowing the QTSPs to request the verification of attributes stored in authentic sources. |
| QTSPAS_07 | The Commission SHALL publish, in agreement with the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group, a technical specification, referring to applicable standards, specifications and procedures, that will cover at least the attributes specified in Annex VI, wherever those attributes rely on authentic sources within the public sector, for which Member States should ensure that measures are taken to allow qualified providers of electronic attestations of attributes to verify by electronic means, at the request of the user, their authenticity against the relevant authentic source. <p><br> Note: These standards and procedures should be, whenever possible, aligned and compatible with those used for the platforms implementing the Once Only Principle (OOTS). There is a clear synergy of both data exchange approaches. In fact, the national OOP node would be a candidate for acting as an intermediary between QTSPs issuing QEEAs and the Authentic Sources. |
| QTSPAS_08 | QTSP SHALL obtain consent of the user to verify the authenticity of the attributes, before requesting the verification of those attributes to the authentic source or designated intermediary. |

#### A.2.3.43 Topic 43 - Embedded disclosure policy

#### A.2.3.48 Topic 48 - Blueprint for requesting data deletion to Relying Parties 

*Short description*

In this use case, Users are requesting the deletion of their personal
data from Relying Parties with which they have interacted.

Users are concerned about having control over their personal data, thus
the function of requesting data deletion ensures a higher degree of
transparency, privacy and control of the Users over their personal
data.Â 

This document explores high-level requirements related to the function
of Users requesting the deletion of their personal data fromÂ Relying
Parties through the EUDI Wallet.

*HLRs*

#### A.2.3.49 Topic 49 - Protocol and interfaces for requesting data deletion to relying parties 

Deleted.

#### A.2.3.50 Topic 50 - Blueprint to report unlawful or suspicious request of data 

*Short description*

In this use case, Users may need to report a Relying Party to the
competent national data protection authority where an unlawful or
inappropriate request for attribute is received through the Wallet
Instance. Users are concerned about having control over their personal
data, and specifically about a Relying Party over-asking for personal
information, thus the function of reporting suspicious or inappropriate
requests ensures a higher degree of transparency, privacy and control of
the users over their personal data.

This is important specifically since there are no automatic processes
that are able to check if the request is consistent with the information
that is registered in the Relying Party registry, and so the
presentation of attributes following a request from a Relying Party
relies mostly on the approval of the User. It may happen that a User
will not be able to correctly understand the request, that the Relying
Party was confused with another one due to a similar name or a phishing
attempt, and so forth. The User may realize only after presenting the
attributes that it was taken from them unlawfully by over-asking, or even
by fraud.

This topic explores high-level requirements related to the function of
Users reporting unlawful or inappropriate attribute requests from
Relying Parties.
