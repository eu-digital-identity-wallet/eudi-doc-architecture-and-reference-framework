# ANNEX 1 - Definitions


## A.1 Introduction 



**Table 1 -- eIDAS regulation definitions**

In this \[ARF\] definitions are used. Several definitions are already
defined in the legal text, these definitions are cited from the eIDAS
Regulation or from the eIDAS Regulation amendment proposal. For
convenience they are listed in [table 1](#a11-table-1---eidas-regulation-definitions).

**Table 2 -- Additional definitions used in this ARF**

In writing this \[ARF\], additional technical terms and definitions are
used. These are listed in [table 2](#a12-table-2----additional-definitions-used-in-this-arf). Note the technical terms and
definitions in [table 2](#a12-table-2----additional-definitions-used-in-this-arf) are intended to be defined in such a way that
they are aligned with the definitions used in the [eIDAS Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG#d1e791-73-1) and
[eIDAS amendment](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e739-1-1)  and should be interpreted as such.

In some cases, the definition or terms has its origin in the context of
specific topics (see [Appendix 2](../annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md), High level Requirements, listed per
topic). To give the relevant context, the topic number appears in
brackets following the definition, e.g., \[[Topic 11](../annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2311-topic-11---pseudonym-attestation)\]. If the definition
is related to two topics, both topic numbers will appear in the
brackets, e.g., \[[Topic 33](../annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2333-topic-33---eudi-wallet-backup-and-restore), [Topic 34](../annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2334-topic-34---migrate-to-a-different-wallet-solution)\]. If the definition is generic to
the \[ARF\] as a whole or to more than 2 topics, no brackets will be
added. If the definition relies on an external source, such as a
standard or a formal publication, that source will be mentioned.
