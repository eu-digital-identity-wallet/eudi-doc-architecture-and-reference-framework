## The Digital Identity Regulation

Under the [Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS)
Regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation),
EU Member States may, on a voluntary basis, notify and recognise, national
electronic identification schemes in their Member States. The recognition of
notified electronic identification became mandatory in 2018.
Yet, there is no requirement for Member States to develop a national electronic
identification and to make it interoperable with those in other Member States.
This has led to discrepancies between countries.
The new Regulation on digital identity addresses shortcomings
in eIDAS by improving the effectiveness of the framework and extending its
benefits to the private sector.
Member States will offer citizens and businesses digital wallets that will be
able to link various aspects of their national digital identities. These may be
provided by public authorities or the private sector, if they are recognized by
the Member States.

The EU Digital Identity Wallet will be:

* **made available to anyone who wants to use it**:  Any EU citizen, resident, and business in the EU who would like to make use of the EU Digital Identity will be able to do so.
* **used widely**: EU Digital Identity Wallets will be used as a way to identify users when providing them with access to public and private digital services across the EU.
* **controlled by users**: The EU Digital Identity Wallets will enable people to choose and keep track of their identity, data and certificates which they share with third parties. Anything which is not necessary to share will not be shared.

Consumers should also be able to access services online without having to use private platforms or unnecessarily sharing personal data. They will have full control of the data they share.

## The Architecture and Reference Framework

On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation
calling on Member States to work towards the development of a Toolbox
including a technical Architecture and Reference Framework
a set of common standards and technical specifications and a
set of common guidelines and best practices.

The Recommendation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis
for the implementation of the European Digital Identity
Framework, without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering
with, or prejudging the legislative process.

The Recommendation foresees that the Toolbox is developed by Member
States’ experts in the eIDAS Expert Group  in close coordination with
the Commission and, where relevant for the functioning of the European
Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet infrastructure, other concerned public
and private sector parties.

This repository contains the "[Architecture and Reference Framework](docs/arf.md)"
(hereinafter the [ARF](docs/arf.md)).
